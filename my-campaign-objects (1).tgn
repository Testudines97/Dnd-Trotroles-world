      Trotroles is a vast and mysterious water planet, a world where the deep, endless oceans are both a source of life and a harbinger of danger. The landscape is dominated by the sea, with only sporadic landmasses breaking through its blue expanse. It is a place of adventure, where explorers must brave both the unpredictable tides and the ancient secrets that lie beneath the waves.

      ____


      ## Geography and Climate


      * **Sunderlis Isle:** The largest landmass on Trotroles, Sunderlis Isle sits roughly at the center of the known world. This vast island is a place of rugged mountains, dense forests, and ancient ruins, surrounded by deep waters that teem with mysterious creatures. While it enjoys a temperate climate during the brief summers, the winter months turn Sunderlis Isle into a harsh, snow-laden realm where survival depends on preparation and resourcefulness.




      * **The Northern Iceshards:** The northernmost seas, known as the Iceshards, are already cold year-round, but in winter they freeze solid, creating a shifting maze of icebergs and treacherous floes. The islands here are stark and isolated, populated by only the hardiest seafaring clans who brave the elements for the rare resources hidden in the icy waters.


      * **Equatorial Islands:** Normally tropical paradises rich in life, the islands around the equator are the first to feel the bite of winter as the cold spreads from the poles. While these islands are warmest during the summer, they become cold and barren in winter, with temperatures dropping enough to blanket the once-green jungles in frost. Inhabitants adapt by migrating or using ancient techniques to shield themselves from the bitter winds.


      * **The Southern Stormlands:** The seas to the south, known as the Stormlands, are unpredictable even in summer. During winter, the already violent waters become an inhospitable nightmare of freezing gales and colossal waves. Few dare venture into these seas during the cold season, as the storms grow ever more violent and the waters teem with monstrous creatures awakened by the cold.


      ## Seasonal Cycle


      **Short, Harsh Winters:** The winters across Trotroles are intense but mercifully brief. During these three months, cold winds sweep across the seas, and even the tropical islands experience a sharp drop in temperature. Inhabitants use this time to hunker down, relying on stored food and the warmth of tightly-knit communities. The seas become treacherous, and travel is limited, turning islands into isolated havens.


      **Long, Warm Summers:** Summers are a time of abundance, lasting nearly nine months. The extended warmth allows for ample farming, fishing, and trading. The islands burst into life with festivals, markets, and seafaring ventures. The tropical equatorial regions thrive, and the northern and southern islands, freed from their winter grip, come alive with vibrant flora and fauna.


      ## Life on Trotroles


      **Island Adaptations:** The people of Trotroles have adapted to their short winters and long summers with ingenuity. Communities are built to withstand the cold, with thick-walled homes and communal hearths to share warmth. During the summer, they celebrate life with colorful festivals, trading expeditions, and feasts.


      **Sunderlis Isle and Sunset Spire:** The city of Sunset Spire stands as a beacon of stability on Sunderlis Isle. Its towering spires and fortified walls protect it from the winter storms, while its bustling markets come alive in the summer months. Merchants, adventurers, and scholars flock to the city during the warmer seasons, making it a hub of culture and commerce.

        Sunderlis Isle is the largest and most significant landmass in the world of Trotroles, a place that bridges the ancient past with the present. The island is divided into two distinct parts—Aurora's Reach in the north and Suncrest in the south—connected by a narrow, treacherous mountainous land bridge that serves as a natural barrier between the two realms. Each side possesses its own unique geography, climate, and secrets, making Sunderlis Isle a land of contrasts and deep mysteries.


        ## Aurora's Reach (Northern Isle)


        Aurora’s Reach, the northern part of Sunderlis Isle, is a circular, frost-touched land dominated by snow-capped mountains and dense forests of conifers. The cold climate makes this region harsh, with long winters that blanket the landscape in snow and ice. Yet, it is also a place of striking beauty, where the auroras dance across the night sky, lighting up the frosty peaks.


        * **The Elemental Gate of Fire:** Before the Great Sundering, Aurora’s Reach was the heart of dragonborn civilization. The eastern side of the island features a great river that flows into a vast central lake, where ancient ruins now lie partially submerged. These ruins are remnants of the once-mighty dragonborn city, known for its mastery of fire magic. At the heart of the ruins stands the Elemental Gate of Fire, an ancient portal that once channeled primal fire energy. Now dormant and surrounded by cracked stone, it serves as a haunting reminder of the island’s lost glory.


        * **The Ruins of @[](ornbdragek):** The former dragonborn city, @[](ornbdragek), is now a desolate expanse filled with broken towers and crumbled walls. It was once the pinnacle of magical innovation and the main stronghold for those who controlled the Elemental Gate of Fire. Following the Great Sundering, the city fell into ruin, and its remaining secrets are guarded by frigid winds and lingering magical anomalies.


        ## Suncrest (Southern Isle)


        Suncrest, the southern part of Sunderlis Isle, contrasts sharply with its northern counterpart. While Aurora's Reach is cold and rugged, Suncrest enjoys a warmer, more temperate climate, with lush forests, rolling hills, and fertile lands bathed in sunlight. The summers here are long and bountiful, making it the most habitable region on Trotroles.


        * **Sunset Spire:** The pride of Suncrest is Sunset Spire, the largest and most prosperous city in all of Trotroles. Positioned near a large lake fed by a river flowing from the west, the city is a thriving center of trade, culture, and learning. The city's towering spires rise above the landscape, catching the last light of the setting sun, which gives it its name. Built with elegant stonework and intricate designs, Sunset Spire is a beacon of civilization in an otherwise wild and unpredictable world.


        * **The Heart of Commerce and Culture:** Sunset Spire serves as the main hub for the exchange of goods, knowledge, and magic (now returning in unstable bursts since the reappearance of the Feywild portals). Merchants from across the islands and distant lands sail to its ports, making it a melting pot of different cultures and races. However, the city remains ever-vigilant against the dangers that lurk beyond the safety of its walls.


        ## The Land Bridge: A Perilous Crossing


        Connecting Aurora’s Reach and Suncrest is the Stormspire Pass, a narrow, treacherous land bridge carved through the mountains. Buffeted by frigid winds from the north and warmer gusts from the south, this pass is often covered in ice and fog, making it a hazardous journey even for the most experienced travelers. The bridge is littered with the remnants of old watchtowers and fortifications, remnants of a time when dragonborn and humans defended their territories from ancient threats.


        ## Myth and Mystery


        Sunderlis Isle is a land steeped in legends. Stories of elemental spirits, forgotten magic, and hidden treasures abound. It is said that deep beneath the ruins of Drak'Shinar, ancient secrets about the true nature of the Great Sundering lie waiting to be uncovered. Meanwhile, the people of Sunset Spire look to the stars for guidance, fearing the return of the chaos that once tore their world apart.

          ## Suncrest

          The Suncrest region is a vibrant and diverse land filled with natural beauty and rich resources. In contrast to the cold, rugged landscape of the northern Aurora's Reach, Suncrest enjoys long, warm summers and brief but harsh winters. Its fertile soils, lush forests, and abundant waters have allowed it to become a prosperous hub of civilization in Trotroles. This island is home to the largest population centers in the known world, with cities, towns, and natural wonders spread across its varied landscape.


          ## Central Heart: The Great Lake and Sunset Spire


          At the heart of Suncrest lies a sprawling Great Lake, a serene and expansive body of water fed by the Aurelin River, which flows from the western mountains. Rising majestically from the center of the lake is the grand city of Sunset Spire, the largest and most influential city in all of Trotroles.


          ## The Western Farmlands: Aurathal Fields


          Flowing westward from the Great Lake, the Aurelin River meanders through the bountiful Aurathal Fields before reaching the sea. These fertile lands are home to the farm city of the high elves, known as Elandar’s Harvest. Here, the high elves cultivate grains, fruits, and magical herbs with great care, ensuring a plentiful supply of food for the region. The river's nourishing waters make Aurathal Fields a thriving agricultural center, with crops grown using a blend of nature magic and traditional farming techniques.


          * ***Aurathal Crest:*** A bundle of wheat surrounded by flowing water, representing the bounty of Aurathal Fields.


          ## The Southern Deciduous Forests: Eldoria Woods


          To the far south of Suncrest lies the vast Eldoria Woods, a deciduous forest that stretches as far as the eye can see. The Eldoria Woods are known for their towering oaks, ancient groves, and abundant wildlife. This dense woodland provides timber, medicinal herbs, and hunting grounds, but it also conceals hidden dangers for the unwary.


          ## The Verdant Forest and Eldergrove City


          In the northeastern region of the island lies the lush Verdant Forest, home to the mystical ruins of Eldergrove, an ancient city once shared by wood elves and high elves. The city has long since been overtaken by nature, with its ivy-covered walls and hidden courtyards serving as a sanctuary for druids and rangers. Eldergrove remains a place of deep magic and is guarded fiercely by the elves who still roam its overgrown streets.

          * ***Eldergrove Emblem:*** A leaf intertwined with vines encirc


          ## The Eastern Mining Town: Ironglade


          On the eastern side of Suncrest, nestled in the foothills of the Jagged Cliffs, lies the industrious mining town of Ironglade. Here, miners delve deep into the earth to extract precious metals and gemstones. The town is known for its skilled blacksmiths and artisans, who transform raw materials into weapons, tools, and intricate jewelry that are highly sought after across Trotroles.

          * ***Ironglade Sigil:*** A crossed hammer and pickaxe with a gemstone at the center, signifying the hard work of Ironglade’s miners.


          ## The Western Swamps and Neighboring City


          To the west of the Aurelin’s mouth lies the Mistfen Marsh, a sprawling and mysterious swamp. This wetland is both feared and respected for its hidden creatures and treacherous terrain. Despite its dangers, it is also a source of rare herbs and alchemical ingredients.


          Just above the swamps is the bustling city of Ravenmoor, the second-largest settlement on Suncrest. Unlike the elegance of Sunset Spire, Ravenmoor is more rugged and practical, focused on food production, fishing, and trade. The city's modest Blackwater Harbor limits its size but remains essential for transporting goods from the farmlands and surrounding areas.


          * ***Ravenmoor Insignia:*** A raven clutching an ear of corn, representing the city’s focus on agriculture and resourcefulness amidst the Mistfen Marsh.

                    # $[objectname]


                    The Yawning Portal, a renowned inn and tavern located in the heart of the @[](avjrwegyuw) of @[](izwulaovpv), is famous for its role as the main entryway to the legendary dungeon known as Undermountain. At the center of the taproom lies the iconic Entry Well, a glowing, circular shaft that descends into the depths of this sprawling labyrinth. Owned and operated by the legendary adventurer @[](rkcykwttry) the Wanderer, the Yawning Portal is a haven for those who seek fame, fortune, or folly in the mysterious halls of @[](bqylcbeuph).


                    The name "Yawning Portal" evokes both the mysterious chasm that beckons daring souls and the endless stream of wild tales shared by its patrons. It’s not just a starting point for expeditions; it’s also a sanctuary for adventurers returning from the brink and a hub for storytelling, revelry, and intrigue.


                    ## Structure and Design


                    Over its long history, the Yawning Portal has undergone several reconstructions, owing to the inevitable fires, magical mishaps, and adventurer-induced accidents. Today, the tavern is a sprawling, robust structure of unpainted fieldstone and weathered slate. The building’s walls are three feet thick, and its steeply angled roof is adorned with lightning rods and a weatherworn weathervane.


                    A large wooden signboard, carved with the name "Yawning Portal" in deep, weathered letters, hangs above the front door. This sign has been salvaged and restored after every reconstruction, a testament to the inn’s storied past. The main entrance leads into a welcoming lobby, where a reception desk is staffed by a sharp-eyed attendant, and rows of hooks and cubbies accommodate guests’ belongings.


                    Adjoining the inn is a sturdy stable that caters to patrons’ mounts, while nearby shops and bakeries provide additional conveniences.


                    ## The Taproom


                    The taproom, sprawling and lively, forms the heart of the Yawning Portal. Polished wooden pillars support the high ceiling, while rich blue tapestries and warm wooden paneling decorate the walls. The floor, though worn with age and countless footsteps, gleams from diligent care. At the center of the room, the Entry Well draws all eyes—a glowing shaft that descends into Undermountain’s uppermost level.


                    The taproom bustles with life: the murmur of conversations, the clinking of tankards, and the crackle of a grand hearth create an inviting atmosphere. The lighting is a mix of warm chandeliers fashioned from wagon wheels and floating driftglobes, whose ethereal glow complements the shimmering light of the well.


                    Patrons range from seasoned adventurers preparing to descend into @[](bqylcbeuph) to merchants and nobles eager to hear tales of danger and discovery. Heavy wooden tables and chairs are arranged around the well, allowing for gatherings and celebrations—or the occasional brawl. The sturdy furnishings are built to withstand the inevitable roughhousing.


                    ## Upper Levels and Guest Accommodations


                    The Yawning Portal’s second and third floors house guest rooms, accessible via wooden staircases that rise from the taproom. These rooms, sixteen on each floor, are cozy and well-appointed, with warm fireplaces and comfortable furnishings. During the colder months, heated stones are provided to keep rooms snug.


                    Overlooking the taproom, balconies on the upper floors offer guests a bird’s-eye view of the Entry Well’s activity. These spots are especially popular among wealthy merchants and nobles, who prefer to watch the adventurers below without mingling too closely.


                    ## Undermountain’s Allure


                    The Yawning Portal owes its fame not just to its comforts but to the portal itself—a glowing well that serves as the primary route into the Undermountain. This vast dungeon, riddled with danger and treasure, has drawn adventurers from across the realms for centuries. Durnan, the enigmatic owner, is the sole keeper of the magic that controls access to the well, and only he can activate its descent mechanism.


                    Rumors abound of secret passages beneath the inn, hidden chambers that lead to alternate entrances to Undermountain. While Durnan neither confirms nor denies these whispers, the allure of such secrets adds to the inn’s mystique.


                    ## The Cellars


                    ### Layout and Mysteries

                    Accessed by a stone stairway, the Yawning Portal’s cellar is a dimly lit space with a low roof supported by stone pillars. This area is illuminated by a single torch and contains vast stores of provisions, including massive casks of wine, barrels of salted fish, smoked hams, pickles, and candied fruits in syrup.


                    The cellar is guarded by a stone golem and a watchspider, ensuring that intruders cannot easily exploit its secrets.


                    Behind a curtained archway lies a hidden landing equipped with a winch, rope, and grappling hook. This landing opens onto a steep shaft leading to a flooded section of Undermountain’s first level, believed to be a cistern. Even Durnan himself claims no knowledge of its connection to the dungeon's depths.


                    ### Secrets of the Deepest Cellar

                    The deepest wine cellar houses not only rare vintages but also relics of Durnan’s adventuring days, such as:


                    *    A glowing periapt from a lich, repurposed as a lamp.

                    *    A pair of giant orc tusks.

                    *    Almost two dozen enchanted swords, helms, and other trophies.


                    These items anchor powerful magical wards, ensuring the cellar’s security. A secret compartment in one of the stone pillars conceals Grimvault, Durnan’s trusty broadsword from his adventuring days, accessible by pressing the fifth stone on the pillar.


                    ### Connection to Skullport


                    An arched passage in the deepest cellar leads to a staircase descending to Bonewatch Pass, a tunnel that connects directly to Skullport, emerging in the ceiling of the Crock and Helm inn. This route is heavily trapped and inhabited by kobolds and carrion crawlers, though Durnan cleared many of these threats in 1358. Magical wards restrict access, allowing only Durnan to pass freely.


                    ## Atmosphere and Clientele


                    The Yawning Portal attracts a vibrant mix of patrons:

                        Adventurers: From novices seeking glory to retirees spinning tales of their exploits.
                    *    Thrill-seekers: Young nobles and fans of adventuring life often come to bask in the lively atmosphere.

                    *    Merchants and Laborers: Dock workers, shopkeepers, and sailors unwind here after a long day’s work.

                    *    Travelers: Guests from the far corners of Faerûn, Kara-Tur, and even other planes of existence.


                    On quieter evenings, the taproom becomes a stage for storytelling, where experienced delvers share secrets about Undermountain—for the price of a drink or meal. On busier nights, the noise and revelry reach a fever pitch, yet Durnan and his loyal staff maintain order.


                    Despite the armed adventurers, brawls are rare, thanks to Durnan’s imposing presence and formidable skill. Known for his tankard-throwing precision and mastery of Grimvault, Durnan’s reputation deters most troublemakers.


                    ## Room and Board


                    Accommodations


                    The inn offers 32 guest rooms, spread across its upper floors, accessible via wooden staircases. Rooms range from modest to luxurious:

                    Durnan occasionally rewards guests with a complimentary chopforest salad, a traditional wood elven dish, considered a good omen for upcoming adventures.


                    ## Entertainment and Gambling


                    Certainly! Below is the enhanced and richly detailed description of the Yawning Portal, incorporating all the information you provided and organizing it into sections for ease of reference:

                    The Yawning Portal


                    The Yawning Portal, an iconic inn and tavern, sits at the heart of the Bastion Ward of Sunset Spire. Renowned across realms, it serves as both a sanctuary for adventurers and a gateway to the legendary dungeon known as Undermountain.


                    At the center of its fame is the Entry Well, a glowing shaft descending into the depths of Undermountain’s perilous halls. The inn is owned and operated by Durnan the Wanderer, a grizzled yet enigmatic figure whose personal history is as legendary as the inn itself. A hub of adventure, intrigue, and camaraderie, the Yawning Portal is a cornerstone of the city’s identity.

                    The Cellars

                    Layout and Mysteries


                    Accessed by a stone stairway, the Yawning Portal’s cellar is a dimly lit space with a low roof supported by stone pillars. This area is illuminated by a single torch and contains vast stores of provisions, including massive casks of wine, barrels of salted fish, smoked hams, pickles, and candied fruits in syrup.


                    The cellar is guarded by a stone golem and a watchspider, ensuring that intruders cannot easily exploit its secrets.


                    Behind a curtained archway lies a hidden landing equipped with a winch, rope, and grappling hook. This landing opens onto a steep shaft leading to a flooded section of Undermountain’s first level, believed to be a cistern. Even Durnan himself claims no knowledge of its connection to the dungeon's depths.

                    Secrets of the Deepest Cellar


                    The deepest wine cellar houses not only rare vintages but also relics of Durnan’s adventuring days, such as:

                        A glowing periapt from a lich, repurposed as a lamp.
                        A pair of giant orc tusks.
                        Almost two dozen enchanted swords, helms, and other trophies.

                    These items anchor powerful magical wards, ensuring the cellar’s security. A secret compartment in one of the stone pillars conceals Grimvault, Durnan’s trusty broadsword from his adventuring days, accessible by pressing the fifth stone on the pillar.

                    Connection to Skullport


                    An arched passage in the deepest cellar leads to a staircase descending to Bonewatch Pass, a tunnel that connects directly to Skullport, emerging in the ceiling of the Crock and Helm inn. This route is heavily trapped and inhabited by kobolds and carrion crawlers, though Durnan cleared many of these threats in 1358. Magical wards restrict access, allowing only Durnan to pass freely.

                    Atmosphere and Clientele


                    The Yawning Portal attracts a vibrant mix of patrons:

                        Adventurers: From novices seeking glory to retirees spinning tales of their exploits.
                        Thrill-seekers: Young nobles and fans of adventuring life often come to bask in the lively atmosphere.
                        Merchants and Laborers: Dock workers, shopkeepers, and sailors unwind here after a long day’s work.
                        Travelers: Guests from the far corners of Faerûn, Kara-Tur, and even other planes of existence.

                    On quieter evenings, the taproom becomes a stage for storytelling, where experienced delvers share secrets about Undermountain—for the price of a drink or meal. On busier nights, the noise and revelry reach a fever pitch, yet Durnan and his loyal staff maintain order.


                    Despite the armed adventurers, brawls are rare, thanks to Durnan’s imposing presence and formidable skill. Known for his tankard-throwing precision and mastery of Grimvault, Durnan’s reputation deters most troublemakers.

                    Room and Board

                    Accommodations


                    The inn offers 32 guest rooms, spread across its upper floors, accessible via wooden staircases. Rooms range from modest to luxurious:

                        Luxury Room: 3 gp per night, including morningfeast and evenfeast.

                    Menu


                    The kitchen never closes, providing hearty meals and unique delicacies:

                        Seafood: Quipper and chips with condiments like Seaturtle gravy and Hundur sauce.
                        Meats: Rothé steak and thick-cut ham sandwiches.
                        Desserts: Laumberry pie, buttermilk biscuits with elderberry preserves, and brackleberry jam.

                    Durnan occasionally rewards guests with a complimentary chopforest salad, a traditional wood elven dish, considered a good omen for upcoming adventures.

                    Entertainment and Gambling


                    The Yawning Portal offers unique entertainment centered around adventurers descending into Undermountain:


                    *    Patrons place bets on whether adventurers will return, their condition, and how many of their party will survive.

                    *    Toasts and taunts accompany the departure and return of delvers.


                    Music and performances are a staple of the taproom, with acts ranging from drunken songs by adventurers to performances by bards like Mattrim “Threestrings” Mereg and halfling bands like the Sing-Alongs.


                    ## Inhabitants and Staff


                    ### Management


                    The Yawning Portal is owned and operated by Durnan, who rarely leaves the premises. His keen eyes and steady hands have kept the inn running for decades.


                    ###Staff


                    The inn is supported by a dedicated team, including:


                    *    Bonnie: A cheerful barmaid.

                    *    Jhaax Dolbruin: An ex-adventurer turned bartender and occasional bouncer.

                    *    Marrauda Belaskurth and Luranla Dreer: Experienced kitchen maids.

                    *    Jarandur Tallstand and Parth Melander: Talented cooks.


                    ### Security


                    Beyond the stone golem and watchspider in the cellar, the taproom itself is under constant surveillance by off-duty City Guards and Durnan’s former adventuring comrades.

                The Greenward Sanctuary in Sunset Spire is far from a gloomy graveyard; it is a magnificent park teeming with life, history, and artistry. Filled with rolling hills, meticulously tended flower beds, and artfully arranged clusters of trees and bushes, this serene sanctuary serves as both a memorial and a retreat for the living. Here, residents gather to honor their ancestors amidst stunning sculptures and impressive architecture, making it a beloved part of the city’s cultural landscape.


                **A Living Museum**


                Long ago, the citizens of Sunset Spire abandoned traditional burials, opting instead for ornate mausoleums. Many of these grand structures open into extradimensional spaces, allowing families to mourn and inter their loved ones in a more meaningful way. Nobles and wealthy merchants have historically vied to create the most impressive memorials, resulting in an eclectic array of styles and concepts that reflect the height of artistic skill. The Greenward Sanctuary has become an open-air museum, showcasing some of the most hauntingly beautiful statues ever crafted in marble and bronze.


                **The Warriors' Monument**


                Among its many attractions, the Warriors' Monument stands as a testament to the city’s valor. This intricate sixty-foot-high fountain depicts a circle of valiant men and women striking down trolls, orcs, and other dark foes, all depicted in a dynamic struggle. Above them, a flying griffon rider pierces a skeletal knight adorned with the symbol of Morrak, the god of the dead. The monument's design cleverly integrates water that flows from the wounds of the combatants, creating an evocative scene that captures the spirit of resilience and defiance.


                **A Celebration of Life and Remembrance**


                For the people of Sunset Spire, the Greenward Sanctuary is more than a resting place for the departed; it is a vibrant part of their lives. Families and friends often pack midday feasts to enjoy picnics among the beauty of the park, reflecting the deep connection between life and memory. Strolling through its paths, visitors are reminded of the stories and legacies that have shaped their community, making the Greenward Sanctuary a cherished landmark filled with both history and heart.

                ## @[](ufqxcgmecw)


                The Field Ward of Sunset Spire was not always the bustling, chaotic sprawl it is today. Once an open expanse between the city’s northernmost walls, it was originally left bare as a defensive killing field in times of war. Over time, however, it became a haven for those with nowhere else to turn—refugees from calamities, outcasts, and the dispossessed. In their determination to build a life within sight of Sunset Spire’s gates, they transformed the area into a sprawling, self-made district.


                Though not officially recognized as one of the city's wards, the Field Ward operates as a de facto district, teeming with makeshift homes, muddy streets, and a rough-hewn community spirit. It is a place where desperation and resilience collide. Lacking oversight from the City Watch and barely under the purview of the City Guard, lawlessness often reigns unchecked, and many crimes go unpunished. The Guard keeps a watchful eye from the walls but rarely intervenes unless the safety of those moving in and out of Sunset Spire is directly threatened.


                Life in the Field Ward is harsh. It lacks the basic amenities afforded to other districts—there is no sewer system, and the Dungsweepers’ Guild doesn’t venture here. The air carries the pungent scent of uncollected waste and the acrid stench of the slaughterhouses, smokehouses, and leatherworks operated by the Guild of Butchers, which were forced out of the city proper due to their noisome practices. For all its grime and grittiness, the Field Ward is a hub of industrious activity and the site of many workers' first steps toward a better future.


                Travelers who find themselves here should tread carefully. Befriending a butcher or a craftsman—those accustomed to wielding sharp knives—is a wise move. T@[](koxetcapaf), located at the corner of Endshift Street and Breezeway, offers a glimmer of safety. A favored haunt of off-duty City Guard members, it is one of the few places where outsiders can seek guidance or protection. While the guards are not obligated to intervene in Field Ward affairs, they are often willing to ensure travelers reach the city proper without harm—especially if reminded of their duty to safeguard visitors.


                The Field Ward, for all its challenges, is a testament to human resilience and determination. It may not possess the elegance or splendor of Sunset Spire’s grander districts, but it hums with the raw energy of survival and hope, offering a glimpse into the lives of those who labor in the shadow of the city’s walls.

                 It was a magically-created temperate forest set within naturally occurring caverns, encircled by the River of the Depths.

                The domain was engineered to resemble the surface world, complete with changing seasons, imported animals, and a wide-open, illusory sky that perfectly displayed the stars and the moon as they appeared over Toril. The forest of Wyllowwood specifically was the magically created home of the eccentric @[](skjyxucydv).


                Forest


                The beaches of the River of the Depths were quite narrow and comprised small stones and pebbles. The trees nearest its waters were among the largest in Wyllowwood, with their tangled branches forming a thick canopy that extended beyond the water's edge.


                The forest of Wyllowwood was a lush and inviting locale, seemingly completely out of place within the surrounding tunnels and caves of Undermountain. It had at least two canopies, the larger of which stood over 80 feet tall (24.4 meters). The second, somewhat smaller canopy was more dense however, comprising a mix of both deciduous and coniferous species of temperate trees. Fruiting bushes, shrubs, and flowering plants could be commonly found. Roses were notably exempted from this selection as their presence displeased @[](skjyxucydv).


                The forest floor was sporadically littered with rusted weapons, damaged armor, empty bottles, and other items that had been left by adventurers that had journeyed through, and occasionally died within, Wyllowwood. For every humanoid that was killed by @[](skjyxucydv) hands, she crafted a small, totemic doll and hung it from the branches of one of her trees.

          blurb: >+
            # $[objectname]


            Ironglade stands resilient at the base of the Jagged Cliffs, a bastion of industry and determination. While its people extract and transport vast amounts of raw iron, metals, and uncut gemstones to the trade hubs of Sunset Spire and Ravenmoor, the town itself thrives on the song of its labor. Tieflings, the majority population, have a deep cultural connection to their mining tools, often personifying their pickaxes and hammers with songs passed down through generations. The rhythmic singing that echoes through the mines is not just tradition but a source of pride, binding the community in harmony as they work.


            Despite its isolation as a landlocked town, Ironglade has thrived, not only through the richness of its mines but also by fortifying itself against external threats. Its stone walls, reinforced with iron and guarded by The Silver Chain, protect both its people and its precious cargo. However, competition among the three major mines fuels much of the town’s internal dynamics, creating a fiery and often cutthroat atmosphere.


            ## The Triad Mines

            The three mines of Ironglade are the town's lifeblood, but their intense rivalry shapes every aspect of its economy and politics. Each mine claims dominance in production, innovation, and worker loyalty, vying to prove itself as the most indispensable operation in the town. The competition often spills into the streets in the form of propaganda, hiring contests, and disputes.

            ### Deepstone Delve

            **Specialty:** Iron and Coal.


            **Leadership:** Rakal Ironsoul, a pragmatic tiefling foreman.

            Deepstone Delve is the oldest and most stable of the mines, producing the bulk of Ironglade’s raw iron and coal. It relies on sheer volume to maintain its dominance, and its workers pride themselves on efficiency. Rakal Ironsoul ensures the operation runs smoothly but faces growing pressure to expand deeper into riskier veins.


            ### Gemhearth Quarry

            **Specialty:** Gemstones.


            **Leadership:** Mardin Fellspike, a shrewd and ambitious tiefling.

            Gemhearth Quarry specializes in uncut gemstones, the most lucrative export from Ironglade. While its production is not as high as the others, its shipments fetch the best prices. Mardin’s aggressive tactics to secure trade contracts often draw criticism from rival miners, though his operation is undeniably successful.


            ### Moltenrock Vein

            **Specialty:** Rare Metals (Mithral, Adamantine).


            **Leadership:** Loria Stonevein, a fierce dwarven overseer.

            Moltenrock Vein is the most dangerous mine to work in, as it delves deep into treacherous veins of rare metals. Despite the risks, Loria’s team takes pride in extracting the most valuable materials in Ironglade. However, the mine’s safety record and high worker turnover are frequent points of contention.


            ## The Silver Chain

            Ironglade’s strategic importance as a mining hub has made security paramount. The Silver Chain, a semi-independent mercenary guild, is contracted to defend the town and its caravans. This guild also plays an active role in the mines' rivalry, as each mine hires its own Silver Chain squad to guard their operations, creating factions within the guild. The Silver Chain’s leaders, a pair of twin tieflings named Zyra and Drayth Redthorn, maintain a delicate balance of neutrality but secretly exploit the competition for their own gain.


            ## Landmarks in Ironglade

            **Emberlight Cathedral**A modest but beloved stone church, dedicated to Kaaris, the Hammer of Prosperity, the deity of labor and wealth. Blessings are performed here for tools, workers, and caravans before they depart. Its altar is surrounded by an intricate iron mosaic, created by miners from all three mines.


            **The Cracked Pick Tavern** The largest tavern in Ironglade, frequented by miners from all three operations. It’s a hub of camaraderie and rivalry, where tensions sometimes flare into friendly competitions—or outright brawls.


            **The Trade Square** The bustling heart of commerce, where raw materials are weighed, inspected, and loaded for transport. Each mine has its own dedicated space within the square, guarded by Silver Chain squads.


            **The Singing Cliffs** A natural phenomenon near the mines where winds passing through narrow rock formations create haunting, melodic sounds. Miners often liken the music to their own songs and consider it a sacred site.


            **Iron Bastion Walls** The defensive perimeter of Ironglade, these iron-reinforced walls are patrolled by Silver Chain mercenaries. Watchtowers are stationed at intervals, and the gates are heavily fortified, reflecting the town’s reliance on security.

            Islemoor Haven is a small, secluded fishing village on the eastern coast of Suncrest, near the Crossing. It was founded by a group of settlers seeking refuge from the chaos of the mainland during the early years after the Great Sundering. Despite its isolation, the village thrives on its bountiful fish harvests and the rare herbs found in the nearby coastal marshes. Locals whisper of strange lights that sometimes appear on the water at night, said to be remnants of old magic lost in time.

            The Verdant Forest is a vast, ancient woodland that stretches across the northeastern region of Suncrest, shrouded in a perpetual veil of mist and dappled sunlight. This forest is a place where the natural and magical worlds intertwine seamlessly, creating a unique ecosystem teeming with life and mystical wonders.


            ### Landscape and Atmosphere


            Entering the Verdant Forest feels like stepping into another realm. Towering, centuries-old trees with emerald green canopies create a dense cover, allowing only slivers of sunlight to reach the forest floor. The air is fragrant with the scent of pine, wildflowers, and damp earth, while the sound of rustling leaves, bird calls, and the distant trickle of hidden streams fills the air. Ferns, mosses, and vibrant wildflowers carpet the ground, and patches of luminescent fungi glow softly in the shadowy underbrush, illuminating hidden trails after dusk.


            The forest's terrain varies from gentle hills to deep, shadowy glens and crystal-clear pools fed by underground springs. Narrow, meandering paths, often obscured by twisting roots and overgrown foliage, lead travelers deeper into the heart of the forest. The Verdant Forest is alive with magic, and those who venture too far from the known paths often find themselves disoriented by strange illusions or whispered voices that seem to drift through the leaves.


            ### The Hidden City of Eldergrove


            Nestled deep within the forest lies the Eldergrove, an ancient, overgrown elven city. Once a bustling haven for both high elves and wood elves, the city is now a maze of ivy-covered ruins, with graceful stone archways and crumbling towers overtaken by nature. Eldergrove is said to be protected by powerful enchantments that keep it hidden from outsiders. Only those with the blessing of the forest's druids or the guidance of an elven ranger can find their way to its heart.


            The city itself is centered around a massive, ancient oak tree known as Gaea's Heart, believed to have been a conduit of magical energy in ages past. The roots of this great tree twist and intertwine with the ruins, creating natural hallways and chambers where druids and forest guardians still dwell. Eldergrove remains a sanctuary for the elves who protect it, as well as a refuge for those seeking solace away from the turmoil of the outside world.


            ### Flora and Fauna

            The Verdant Forest is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, many of which cannot be found anywhere else in Trotroles. The trees here include towering redwoods, silver-barked beeches, and whispering pines. Exotic plants, such as moonlit lilies that only bloom under the light of a full moon and thorny brambles that move like living creatures, are scattered throughout the underbrush.


            The forest's creatures are just as unique. Small, glowing sprites flit between branches, while deer with antlers of twisted crystal graze peacefully in hidden glades. Wolves, bears, and great owls prowl the deeper parts of the forest, but they are seldom hostile to those who show respect for their home. The Verdant Forest is also rumored to be inhabited by treants, dryads, and other fey beings who protect its secrets and repel those who would do harm.


            ### Mystical Elements and Legends

            The Verdant Forest is steeped in legend, with countless tales of travelers who entered its depths only to emerge years later without aging a day—or, more commonly, never returning at all. It is said that time flows differently within the heart of the forest, especially near Eldergrove. Some believe that the forest itself is sentient, shifting its paths to protect sacred groves or steer intruders away from hidden treasures.


            Local legends also speak of an ancient guardian known as the Emerald Warden, a mysterious figure that appears only when the forest is under threat. This being, whether spirit or druid, is said to wield powerful nature magic and can command the trees and creatures of the forest to rise against intruders.


            ### Cultural Significance

            For the elves of Suncrest, the Verdant Forest is not just a place of residence but a living entity that deserves reverence and protection. It is both a spiritual sanctuary and a source of resources, where the elves gather herbs, hunt, and conduct rituals in harmony with the land. The Verdant Forest embodies their connection to nature and their ancient traditions of balance and guardianship.


            To outsiders, the Verdant Forest is a place of mystery, magic, and untold danger. While its beauty is unparalleled, only the bravest—or most foolish—dare to explore its depths without a knowledgeable guide. Those who enter with respect and good intentions may find hidden wonders, while those who seek to exploit the forest often face the wrath of its protectors.

              Deep within the Verdant Forest of Suncrest lies the ruined city of Eldergrove, a haunting relic of a forgotten era. Once a thriving center of elven culture and arcane mastery, it has since been reclaimed by the encroaching wilderness. Eldergrove is not merely a ruin but a place where ancient stone melds with untamed nature, forming a landscape that is both beautiful and foreboding.


              ### Layout and Atmosphere

              Eldergrove is a city shrouded in mystery, hidden beneath a dense canopy of towering trees. The air is thick with the scent of wet earth, moss, and ancient wood. Mist often lingers between the crumbling towers and fallen archways, casting an ethereal glow in the early morning light. Sunlight filters through the leaves, painting the stone ruins with patches of gold and green.


              At the heart of Eldergrove lies Gaea’s Heart, a colossal, ancient oak tree whose roots have entwined with the city's foundations. This sacred tree once drew power from the Elemental Gate of Earth that lies hidden beneath its gnarled base. The gate, now sealed and dormant, was the source of immense magical energy before the Great Sundering. Eldergrove's elves once used this power to enrich their lands, nurture the forest, and protect their people.

              Eldergrove: The Lost Elven City of Earth

              Deep within the Verdant Forest of Suncrest lies the ruined city of Eldergrove, a haunting relic of a forgotten era. Once a thriving center of elven culture and arcane mastery, it has since been reclaimed by the encroaching wilderness. Eldergrove is not merely a ruin but a place where ancient stone melds with untamed nature, forming a landscape that is both beautiful and foreboding.

              Eldergrove is a city shrouded in mystery, hidden beneath a dense canopy of towering trees. The air is thick with the scent of wet earth, moss, and ancient wood. Mist often lingers between the crumbling towers and fallen archways, casting an ethereal glow in the early morning light. Sunlight filters through the leaves, painting the stone ruins with patches of gold and green.


              At the heart of Eldergrove lies Gaea’s Heart, a colossal, ancient oak tree whose roots have entwined with the city's foundations. This sacred tree once drew power from the Elemental Gate of Earth that lies hidden beneath its gnarled base. The gate, now sealed and dormant, was the source of immense magical energy before the Great Sundering. Eldergrove's elves once used this power to enrich their lands, nurture the forest, and protect their people.


              Guardians of the Gate: The Dragonborn Protectors

              Long before the Great Sundering, the Elemental Gate of Earth was guarded by a noble order of dragonborn warriors. These dragonborn were chosen by the Elder Council of Elves, selected for their unwavering loyalty and strength. They were bound by a sacred oath to protect the gate at all costs, ensuring that the elemental magic of the earth remained in balance.


              These guardians, known as the Stonewardens, were more than mere sentinels; they were deeply respected allies of the elves, often seen as the living embodiment of the gate's strength and resilience. Clad in enchanted armor of jade and obsidian, the Stonewardens were both feared and revered. Their presence alone was said to be enough to deter any who would dare approach the gate with ill intent.


              ### The Great Sundering and the Fall of Eldergrove

              When the Great Sundering struck, causing magic to vanish from Trotroles for a millennium, the power of the Elemental Gate of Earth was sealed. In a desperate attempt to protect their sacred gate, the Elder Council and the Stonewardens performed a powerful ritual, but something went horribly wrong. The ground trembled, the skies darkened, and much of Eldergrove was reduced to ruin.


              The once-thriving city fell silent as many of its inhabitants perished. The dragonborn guardians who survived retreated into the depths of the earth, seeking refuge in hidden caverns, while the elves who remained were scattered. In the centuries that followed, Eldergrove became an overgrown ruin, its secrets buried beneath layers of earth and time.


              ### Architectural Features

              The architecture of Eldergrove reflects the elves' deep connection to the earth. Crumbling stone structures are adorned with intricate carvings of leaves, vines, and mythical creatures. The Central Plaza — once the heart of the city's celebrations and council gatherings — is now overgrown with wildflowers and ivy. At its center stands a shattered monument that once depicted the Stonewardens in all their glory.


              To the east lies the Sanctuary of Stone, a temple dedicated to the elemental spirits of earth. Though its roof has collapsed, the stone columns and mosaic floors still retain their ancient beauty. It is said that the spirits of the fallen dragonborn still linger in the sanctuary, guarding the secrets of the gate.


              ### A New Reality

              In the absence of magic, the elves who survived the Sundering were forced to abandon Eldergrove, leaving it to the relentless embrace of nature. However, the ancient Elemental Gate of Earth beneath Gaea’s Heart remains sealed but intact. Some believe that with the return of magic to Trotroles, the gate could be reactivated, bringing with it both great power and unknown dangers.


              Rumors abound that hidden within Eldergrove are ancient relics, guarded by the spectral remnants of the Stonewardens. Adventurers, scholars, and treasure hunters are drawn to the ruins in search of these artifacts, though few return unscathed.

            ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG3.peJHK5uQ7x1ysRI3tqNP?pid=ImgGn)

            The Mistfen Marshes stretch across the southwestern region of Suncrest, an expansive, murky landscape shrouded in a perpetual, swirling mist. The marshes are a tangled web of brackish waters, twisted trees, and thick, dark reeds that sway gently in the faintest breeze. The ground here is soft and treacherous, with patches of deceptively deep mud hidden beneath a carpet of moss and algae. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth, decaying vegetation, and the occasional pungent waft from bubbling sulfurous pools.


            ### The Atmosphere

            The Mistfen Marshes are a place where time seems to stand still. The thick mist obscures the sun even on the brightest days, casting a ghostly pallor over the landscape. Strange sounds echo through the fog — the croak of unseen frogs, the distant call of a marsh bird, or the splash of something slipping into the dark waters. It is a place that feels forgotten, where the natural world has reclaimed its dominion, and any visitor is merely a trespasser in its eerie tranquility.


            ### The Old Firetower

            Rising unexpectedly from the center of the marsh is the Old Firetower, a lonely, weather-beaten structure that seems wholly out of place amidst the wetlands. The tower is constructed of dark, aged stone, now covered in patches of green moss and creeping vines. Its design suggests that it predates the Great Sundering, likely built by a forgotten civilization to serve as a beacon or watchtower.


            Though it was once a grand structure, the tower now leans slightly, as if tired from centuries of standing guard over the misty expanse. At its peak is a circular platform where an ancient brazier still rests. Though long cold and filled with rainwater, it was once used to light a great fire that could be seen from miles away, serving as a guide for travelers and ships navigating the marsh's treacherous waters.


            ### Mysterious Origins and Legends

            The true purpose of the firetower is shrouded in mystery. Local legends tell of a time when the Elemental Gate of Fire briefly flared to life within the marshes during the chaos of the Sundering, and the tower was hastily erected to control the spread of fire that threatened to consume the entire region. Others claim that the tower was a last bastion against a horde of monstrous creatures that once swarmed from the Underdark before the Great Sundering sealed them away.


            Some scholars speculate that the tower may have been used by an ancient sect of fire-wielding mages or even the dragonborn who once guarded the elemental gates. There are whispers of strange, ghostly lights that flicker in the tower’s upper levels during stormy nights, and locals steer clear of the area, fearing that ancient spirits or magical traps may still guard its secrets.


            ### Exploring the Tower

            The interior of the Old Firetower is a labyrinth of crumbling stone steps and narrow passages. Vines have forced their way through cracks in the walls, while pools of stagnant water have gathered on the lower floors. Moss-covered statues of forgotten guardians line the walls, their features worn smooth by time. Scattered debris — remnants of old scrolls, broken lanterns, and the occasional piece of tarnished armor — hint at a time when the tower was still in use.


            For those brave enough to climb to the top, the view from the circular platform is both breathtaking and ominous. The marsh stretches endlessly in every direction, a sea of mist pierced only by the tops of twisted trees and the occasional shimmer of water. On a clear day, the spires of Sunset Spire City are just barely visible to the northeast.


            ### Flora and Fauna

            Despite its eerie atmosphere, the Mistfen Marshes are teeming with life. Waterlogged trees grow in strange, twisted shapes, their roots rising above the water like gnarled fingers. The marsh is home to a host of creatures, from small amphibians and fish to larger, more dangerous beasts that lurk in the deeper waters. Rumors abound of giant, serpent-like creatures that dwell in the dark pools, and adventurers who stray too far often find themselves the prey of marsh-dwelling predators.

          name: Frostholm
          shared_name: 
          status: 1
          blurb: >
            # $[objectname]

            Nestled against the western slopes of Aurora’s Reach, Frostholm is a village defined by its determination to survive in the unforgiving northern wilderness. The icy winds that whip down from the peaks are a constant reminder of the village’s proximity to the edge of civilization, but Frostholm has endured, standing as a beacon of fortitude and self-reliance.


            ## Origins and Legacy

            Frostholm was established by dragonborn descendants following the Great Sundering, their lineage tied to the ancient guardians of the Elemental Gate of Fire. These dragonborn were forced to abandon their once-grand city near the gate after the Sundering severed the connection to magic and unleashed chaos across the land. Seeking refuge, they journeyed to the icy edges of Aurora’s Reach, carving out a new life in the harsh terrain.


            The dragonborn settlers were joined over time by hardy humans, wandering dwarves, and other outcasts drawn to the remote safety of the frosty slopes. Together, they forged a community that, despite its small size, thrived through cooperation and resourcefulness.


            ## The Village Layout

            **Central Frostholm**

            The heart of Frostholm consists of sturdy, stone-and-wood homes, built to withstand the relentless winds and snowstorms. Central fire pits and a communal longhouse dominate the village, where residents gather to share warmth, food, and stories during the long winters.


            **The Hunter’s Lodge**

            A prominent building near the outskirts, the lodge serves as the hub for trappers, hunters, and ice fishers. Here, game is processed, and the meat and pelts are distributed or stored for trade.


            **The Frostforged Workshop**

            This small forge, run by dragonborn blacksmiths, keeps the ancient traditions of their ancestors alive. The smiths use techniques said to be passed down from the days of the Elemental Gates, crafting weapons and tools designed to endure extreme cold.


            **The Herbalist’s Haven**

            Frostholm’s reliance on its mountain herbs has led to the creation of a renowned herbalist’s hut, perched precariously near the village’s edge. Here, frost-bitten flowers, hardy lichens, and other medicinal plants are dried, distilled, and traded. The herbalists are highly respected for their ability to turn the sparse vegetation into potent remedies and elixirs.


            ## Legends and Mysteries

            **Frostbound Creatures**The mountains near Frostholm are home to strange and dangerous creatures, from frost-coated wolves to ice elementals that are said to stir during the coldest nights. The villagers tell tales of shimmering, dragon-like shapes glimpsed in the blizzards, though whether they are spirits, remnants of the past, or something darker remains a mystery.


            **The Echoing Fire**

            Some elders claim that the spirit of the Elemental Gate of Fire still flickers beneath the ice, its power waiting to be awakened. On rare nights, a faint glow can be seen in the distance, leading to speculation that the gate's legacy is not entirely lost.


            ## Economy and Trade

            * Frost-touched pelts: Warm, durable furs prized for clothing.

            * Mountain herbs: Medicinal plants and elixirs found only in the frigid heights.


            ## Notable Locations

            * **The Icefall Cliff:** A treacherous outcrop overlooking the western sea, where ice cascades shimmer in the sunlight. The cliff is a popular site for both daring adventurers and spiritual reflection.


            * **The Frozen Hollow:** A mysterious cavern near the village, its entrance partially hidden by snowdrifts. Rumored to hold relics of the dragonborn past, it remains largely unexplored due to the lurking frost beasts within.


            * **The Ancestor’s Flame:** A small shrine built from remnants of the dragonborn’s original city, where villagers light a flame to honor their ancestors and seek guidance.


            ## Current Challenges

            Despite its resilience, Frostholm faces many challenges. The rise of frost beasts and elemental disturbances since the return of magic has made life increasingly dangerous. Additionally, the village struggles to maintain its balance between tradition and survival, as younger generations push for more exploration and innovation while elders hold tight to the ways of the past.


            Frostholm stands as a testament to the indomitable will of its people, a place where the spirit of survival burns brightly even in the harshest of winters.

              ## The Glacier's Rest

              The Glacier’s Rest is the only inn in Frostholm, a cozy retreat designed to offer warmth and comfort in the heart of the frozen wilderness. Built from sturdy pine logs and adorned with carvings of frost wolves and snowflakes, the inn exudes a welcoming charm. Its central hearth, a massive stone fireplace, is always lit, providing a gathering place for locals and travelers. The menu features hearty stews, roasted game, and mulled mead, with a special spiced tea popular among those returning from the frigid outdoors.


              ### Owner:

            Nestled on the eastern coast of Aurora’s Reach, Aurorengard is a testament to resilience and cooperation, where a unique alliance between orcs and gnomes has carved a thriving settlement out of the frost-covered wilderness. The town stands as a symbol of ingenuity and determination, built upon the unyielding foundations of hard work and mutual respect.


            ## Founding and Early History


            Aurorengard began humbly as a small logging camp established by orcish settlers. Drawn by the dense, frost-covered pine forests that blanketed the eastern coastline, the orcs saw the potential for harvesting the resilient northern conifers. These trees, prized for their strength and durability, were ideal for constructing ships and fortifications—an invaluable resource in a world slowly recovering from the Great Sundering and the subsequent age of instability.


            The orcs, already renowned for their timber-working skills, quickly established a reputation as master woodcutters and carpenters. However, the unforgiving climate and the dangerous wilderness posed immense challenges. Roaming frost beasts, ice elementals, and the relentless winters made survival a daily struggle. This changed when a group of gnomish engineers, lured by the promise of untapped resources and the potential for invention, arrived at the fledgling camp.


            ## The Orc-Gnome Alliance


            The arrival of the gnomes marked a turning point in Aurorengard’s history. While the orcs brought strength, craftsmanship, and an unyielding work ethic, the gnomes introduced innovation and technical expertise. Together, they forged an alliance that would shape the settlement into the bustling hub it is today.


            The gnomes designed and built steam-powered sawmills to process the hardy timber more efficiently, enabling the town to grow its output tenfold. They also developed intricate heating systems powered by coal and steam to combat the bitter cold, making Aurorengard one of the most comfortable places in the northern reaches despite its harsh environment.


            The orcs, in turn, provided the manpower and logistical expertise to gather the raw materials, construct the town's robust infrastructure, and protect its inhabitants. Their formidable strength was not only key in timber felling but also in defending the settlement against the frequent threats from the wild.


            ## Aurorengard Today


            Aurorengard has grown far beyond its origins as a logging camp. The town’s layout reflects the harmony of its orc and gnome founders.


            * **The Harbor District:** A vital lifeline for trade, the harbor district is filled with gnome-built workshops and warehouses. Here, goods are crafted, stored, and shipped to other parts of Trotroles, making Aurorengard a regional supplier of high-quality timber and ship parts.


            * **The Timber Quarter:** Along the forest’s edge, sturdy timber lodges and workshops constructed by the orcs serve as homes and workspaces. The rhythmic sound of axes and saws fills the air as teams of orcs continue to harvest the abundant trees.


            * **The Emberwatch Tower:** At the heart of the town stands the repurposed firetower, now a symbol of Aurorengard’s vigilance and unity. From its heights, sentries keep a constant watch for frost beasts and ice elementals descending from the mountains, their presence a constant reminder of the region's dangers.


            Despite the hardships of life in Aurora’s Reach, Aurorengard thrives. The partnership between orcs and gnomes has fostered a vibrant community, where innovation and tradition coexist. Festivals celebrating both orcish strength and gnomish ingenuity are held regularly, filling the streets with music, food, and warmth.


            ## The Future of Aurorengard

            Aurorengard is more than just a settlement; it is a beacon of what cooperation can achieve in the face of adversity. Plans are underway to expand the harbor, allowing for larger ships to dock and increasing trade opportunities. Meanwhile, the gnomes are experimenting with new machinery to further enhance the efficiency of the sawmills and heating systems.


            Though challenges remain—chief among them the ever-present frost beasts and the unpredictable northern weather—the people of Aurorengard are unshaken. Together, they continue to carve out a future as enduring and resilient as the timber they harvest.


            ## Political Structure of Aurorengard

              # $[objectname]


              The Harbor District of @[](syvnpfnaqv) is the town’s bustling epicenter of commerce and ingenuity, situated along the rocky eastern coastline where the cold waves of the northern seas crash against sturdy, gnome-crafted docks. A symphony of activity fills the air, with the clatter of tools, the creak of timber, and the shouts of workers harmonizing with the cry of seabirds.


              ## Layout and Design


              The Harbor District is a striking blend of orcish sturdiness and gnomish inventiveness. The docks are built from reinforced northern pine, harvested from the nearby forests and treated with a special gnome-engineered sealant to resist the frigid saltwater and icy conditions. Large cranes, powered by steam engines and intricate pulley systems, stand like sentinels along the piers, hauling logs, barrels, and crates onto waiting ships.


              * **Warehouses:** Massive timber-framed buildings line the waterfront, used to store processed wood, ship parts, and supplies. Orcs oversee the loading and unloading operations, their strength ensuring the smooth movement of heavy cargo.


              * **Workshops:** Compact yet efficient gnome-run workshops are interspersed throughout the district, where tinkers and craftsmen build tools, repair machinery, and fine-tune the cranes and sawmills.


              * **The Market Square:** At the heart of the district lies the market square, where traders and merchants set up stalls to exchange goods with visiting ships. It’s a vibrant area where one might find everything from fresh fish caught in the icy waters to ornate gnome-made trinkets.


              ## Activity and Commerce


              The district serves as the lifeblood of Aurorengard’s economy. Timber is the primary export, with logs and planks of northern pine shipped across @[](klgsnmpeuf). Ships specially designed for icy waters are also constructed here, their hulls reinforced with durable wood and iron fittings.


              Fishing is another significant industry, with orc and gnome crews venturing into the frigid seas to bring back hauls of hardy northern fish. The harbor is also the main point of contact with traders and adventurers, who come seeking the prized timber and ingenious gnome-made devices.


              ## Defenses and Challenges


              The Harbor District is equipped to withstand the harsh environment of Aurora’s Reach. During the long winters, icebreakers—large, gnome-designed machines mounted on ships—keep the waterways clear of ice. The docks are reinforced against storms, with breakwaters constructed from heavy stones hauled by orc labor.


              The district’s proximity to the wilderness makes it vulnerable to frost beasts and raiding ice elementals. As a result, orc guards regularly patrol the area, and the Emberwatch Tower keeps a constant vigil for any signs of danger. The people of the district are no strangers to working through adversity, their resilience a reflection of the town’s spirit.


              ## Cultural Life


              The Harbor District isn’t just a hub of trade and work; it’s also a place of camaraderie. After a long day, workers gather in the Frostflow Tavern, a cozy meeting spot lit by roaring hearths, where orcs and gnomes alike share stories, songs, and hearty meals. Seasonal festivals often take place here, with the waterfront lit by lanterns as the people celebrate their hard-won successes and honor the unity that makes Aurorengard thrive.


              In the Harbor District, the raw power of orcish labor meets the precision of gnomish innovation, creating a place that stands strong against the icy tides of Aurora’s Reach—a beacon of progress and industry in the frozen north.

              The Emberwatch Tower District is the bustling heart of cultural diversity and community spirit within Aurorengard. Built around the repurposed Emberwatch Tower—a towering structure originally constructed as a fire lookout—the district thrives as a melting pot of races, trades, and ideas. While the Timber Quarter is predominantly orc and gnome, the Emberwatch District attracts travelers, merchants, and settlers of all kinds, from sea elves and humans to dwarves and halflings.


              ## District Description


              * **Architecture:** The district’s layout is a lively mix of influences, with sturdy orcish timber lodges, whimsical gnome workshops, and elegant sea elf stonework. Cobblestone streets are lined with colorful banners, market stalls, and street performers. Many homes and shops feature hanging lanterns, giving the district a warm, inviting glow at night.


              * **The Emberwatch Tower:** Standing at the district's center, the Emberwatch Tower looms as both a historic landmark and a symbol of community vigilance. Once a beacon of safety during harsh winters, it now serves as a town hall, cultural center, and lookout post for protecting the city. The upper levels are manned by watchkeepers, while the lower floors host public gatherings, performances, and markets.


              * **Marketplace:** Surrounding the tower is a bustling open-air market where traders of all backgrounds sell wares ranging from exotic spices and fabrics to finely crafted tools and magical trinkets. It’s a hub of commerce and cultural exchange.


              ## Key Features

              * **The Grand Amphitheater:** A semicircular stone amphitheater near the tower, used for public meetings, performances, and festivals. It’s a focal point for community celebrations and artistic expression.


              * **The Everbright Plaza:** A lively square where street performers showcase talents and merchants set up temporary stalls. It’s named for the enchanted, ever-burning torches that light the area.


              * **The Whispering Garden:** A tranquil park filled with soft grasses, flowering trees, and small streams. At its center is a fountain surrounded by benches, often frequented by storytellers and bards.


              ## Culture and Diversity

              The Emberwatch District is known for its acceptance and integration of various races and traditions. It’s common to see halflings selling baked goods alongside orcish blacksmiths or dwarven engineers working with sea elf artisans on architectural projects. Festivals are celebrated with blended customs, reflecting the district’s collaborative spirit.

        ## A Year of Rapid Growth

        It has been just a year since the Harengon first leaped through the fey portals into the world of Trotroles. Among the countless islands scattered across this water-filled world, they chose Bramblehop Isle as their primary settlement. When the Harengon arrived, they immediately recognized the potential of this fertile island, rich with lush vegetation, abundant wildlife, and hidden groves reminiscent of their Feywild origins.



        ## Founding Bramblehop


        Within months, the Harengon transformed the island into a vibrant settlement. Utilizing their innate agility and Feywild ingenuity, they quickly built wooden homes nestled in trees, with rope bridges crisscrossing between them. The island’s natural bramble thickets became both a defense and a resource; the Harengon harvested the tough vines to craft homes, fences, and tools.


        The Firewatch Tower, a relic standing oddly in the middle of the marshy land, became a focal point for their new society. The Harengon restored the structure, turning it into a watchtower and gathering hall. This tower also served as a symbol of hope and resilience, lighting the way for travelers and explorers still making their way through the turbulent waters of Trotroles.


        ## Challenges and Adaptations


        However, the Harengon quickly learned that Trotroles was not as welcoming as they had initially hoped. The island's dense marshes and bramble thickets concealed threats — strange, nocturnal creatures that emerged from the depths of the Mistfen Marshes. These creatures, twisted by the lingering remnants of lost magic, occasionally attacked the settlement, forcing the Harengon to fortify their homes and sharpen their survival skills.


        In response to these threats, the Harengon utilized their skills in fortification and camouflage. They dug hidden trenches around the village and set up spiked bramble barriers to deter the creatures. Their natural agility and knack for crafting traps helped them secure their homes, turning Bramblehop Isle into a hidden fortress.


        ## Building Alliances and Exploring Trotroles


        The Harengon also realized they couldn’t thrive alone. They began reaching out to nearby islands, sending swift boats to the coasts of Suncrest to trade with the locals. Despite their Feywild origins, the Harengon have proven themselves as clever negotiators, using their quick wit to secure alliances and trade routes.


        Exploration teams were sent deeper into Trotroles to scout for resources, potential allies, and hidden dangers. These teams mapped out the surrounding seas and charted paths to other, unexplored islands. The Harengon saw Trotroles as a new frontier, filled with opportunities to rebuild the magical society they once had.


        ## A Unique Cultural Identity

        After a year of settlement, Bramblehop has developed a distinct culture. The Harengon celebrate their arrival with the Festival of the First Hop, commemorating the moment they set foot on Trotroles. This festival includes feasting, races through the bramble mazes, and lighting lanterns from the restored Firewatch Tower. Despite their newfound hardships, the Harengon remain optimistic, embracing the spirit of adventure that brought them to this new world.


        ## Looking Ahead


        The Harengon have only just begun to uncover the secrets of Bramblehop Isle. As they adapt to the challenges of Trotroles, they are determined to build a prosperous future. Yet, rumors of new portals, hidden treasures, and lurking dangers in the Mistfen Marshes suggest that their adventure is far from over. The Harengon remain ever curious, hopping toward the unknown with the same boundless energy that brought them here.

        # $[objectname]


        Located far to the west of the sprawling Suncrest Isle, Saint-Peters-Chapel Island is a tiny, secluded speck in the vast ocean of Trotroles. Isolated from the bustling trade routes and far from the conflicts that ripple across the mainland, it serves as a haven for those seeking a quiet and contemplative life. The island is so remote that it is often forgotten, a mere footnote on nautical maps, making it an ideal retreat for its inhabitants.


        ## A Village of Quiet Souls

        The island's sole settlement, the village of Rasbeek, is a humble collection of homes occupied by turtlefolk who fled the chaos of the larger islands. These gentle beings sought this remote refuge to embrace a life of simplicity, away from the bustling ports and towns like Sunset Spire. Upon their arrival, they discovered an ancient chapel overgrown with brambles and vines. This chapel, now lovingly restored, has become the heart of their community.


        ## Life in Seclusion


        Life on Saint-Peters-Chapel Island is simple and unhurried. The turtlefolk live off the land and sea, fishing in the surrounding waters, tending to modest gardens, and gathering wild herbs. Rasbeek’s villagers share a deep bond, driven by their collective desire for a life free from the pressures of the outside world. The sound of the ocean and the gentle rustle of palm leaves are their only companions.


        ## A Hidden Gem in the Ocean

        The island’s isolation means it is rarely visited by outsiders. In fact, only a few mariners who have strayed off course have stumbled upon its shores. For the turtlefolk, this remoteness is a blessing. They’ve created a peaceful enclave where old stories and traditions are kept alive, far from the prying eyes of adventurers or traders.


        ## The Mystery of the Chapel


        The ancient chapel, which gave the island its name, remains shrouded in mystery. Some villagers claim it was built long before the Great Sundering, hinting at forgotten ties to the magical era. However, the turtlefolk prefer to leave its secrets undisturbed, valuing the tranquility it represents over any potential discoveries.

      In @[](izwulaovpv), joining the Lords' Alliance is both an honor and a commitment. Reserved for citizens with a deep allegiance to the city, even those with questionable pasts can earn membership if they prove loyal to Sunset Spiral. The Lords’ Alliance is a coalition of cities and towns bound by a pact to provide mutual aid and protection in times of need, and with Sunset Spiral’s unmatched influence, it is the most powerful organization in the known world. Skilled operatives, from diplomats to spies and covert agents, safeguard the Alliance’s interests and ensure stability across the realms.


      The Open Lord of Sunset Spiral, Sylara Moonglade, oversees the city with keen insight, keeping watch on adventurers and influential figures through a network of spies. Those who put the city’s welfare above their own gain rewards and may even be recruited as Alliance agents. Sylara’s trusted lieutenant, Talrin Silverwind, acts as her representative, coordinating efforts within Sunset Spiral and across Alliance-held territories.


      Sylara spends most of her time at the Palace of the Spiral, a grand edifice at the city's center. Surrounding it are well-kept quarters for ambassadors and representatives from other Alliance towns, enabling close cooperation and swift coordination.


      **Support from the Lords’ Alliance:**


      * Official Business Status: The City Watch is notified that adventurers are on “official business” for the Alliance, receiving instructions to provide support as needed.

      * Mirt the Masked Lord: A close advisor to Sylara, Mirt hosts adventurers at his somewhat ramshackle estate, sharing knowledge, rumors, and invaluable advice for those loyal to the Alliance.

      * Audience with Sylara Moonglade: Loyal adventurers may be granted a rare audience with Sylara herself, offering recognition and opportunities for strategic counsel.


      As the most powerful force in the realms, the Lords' Alliance of Sunset Spiral maintains the balance and security of its members, solidifying its reputation as a vital protector of stability across the known world.

        # $[objectname]


        Sunset Spire’s skies are safeguarded not by enchanted ships or mechanical marvels but by the valiant Griffon Riders of Celestara. These aerial defenders, mounted upon noble and fearsome griffons, operate from their lofty stronghold, Bastion Keep, perched high on the rugged slopes of Mount Celectra. The riders are celebrated as masters of aerial combat, their skill augmented by the enchanted Rings of Celestial Grace, which enable breathtaking feats of precision and bravery.


        During both martial exhibitions and life-or-death engagements, the Griffon Riders distinguish themselves with daring tactics. Leaping boldly from their mounts, they hurtle toward their foes with dizzying speed, becoming streaks of determination against the sky. Few adversaries can withstand such a relentless assault, their attention split between the approaching rider and the circling griffon poised to strike. At the last moment, the Rings of Celestial Grace activate, halting the riders’ descent as they drift gently through the air. Their griffon companions, bound by trust and training, swoop in to reunite with their riders, transforming what seemed reckless into an awe-inspiring maneuver.


        The synchronization between rider and griffon is unparalleled, ensuring that no airborne or ground-based threat to Sunset Spire endures for long. A strict code keeps the Griffon Riders soaring above the rooftops—not for fear of collision, but to maintain the discipline of their steeds, whose keen senses can be overwhelmed by the tantalizing aromas of the bustling city below.


        The Griffon Riders of Celestara are more than just protectors; they are a symbol of Sunset Spire’s resilience and vigilance, embodying the city's unyielding spirit as they soar above, guardians of the heavens and the earth alike.

      # $[objectname]


      BREGAN D 'AERTHE A character must be a sea elf, preferably a male, to join this faction. Bregan D'aerthe is a company of mercenaries originally made up of the much-derided and dishonorable castaways of destroyed drow houses. The group's leader, Jarlaxle Baenre, is always looking for new members to fill the ranks, and loyalty is what matters to him most. Almost all Bregan D'aertbe members are male be- cause female sea elfs rarely condescend to take orders from a male. A female sea elf can earn a place in the faction by decrying the drow matriarchy and convincing jarlaxle that she would be an asset to the brotherhood. jarlaxle employs non-sea elf operatives as well, none of whom know they're working for him; such individuals aren't considered members of the faction. Bregan D'aerthe is using one of Jarlaxle's legitimate business enterprises-the Sea Maidens Faire - as a front in Waterdeep. The Sea Maidens Faire consists of three carnival ships (the Eyecatcher, the Heartbreaker, and the Hellraiser) crewed by disguised sea elfs and a host of non-sea elf performers (musicians, acrobats, actors, and the like). The ships' cargo consists mostly of wagons and floats that can be hastily assembled and paraded through the city. The sea elf use these parades to draw attention away from their illicit activities. fn the magical guise of a flamboyant Tlluskan captain named Zardoz Zord,Jarlaxle oversees things from the Eyecatcher, his flagship, and the Scarlet Marpenoth, a submarine mounted underneath it. He relies on three sea elf gunslingers- Fel'rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg Masq'il'yr, and Soluun Xibrindas- to do most of his dirty work in the city. For more information on Jarlaxle and his lieutenants, see appendix B. Bregan D'aerthe is skilled at infiltrating criminal organizations. Xanathar's sea elf advisor. Nar'I Xibriodas (see appendix B), is actually a Bregan D'aerthe spy.


      **Bregan D'aerthe support comes in these ways:**


      * Black pouches of coins from an anonymous source. 

      * The adventurers receive an invitation lo dine with Zardoz Zord aboard his flagship, during which jarlaxJe takes their measure and offers assistance if they impress him.

      * Bregan D'aerthe members buy off or quietly dispose of individuals who threaten the adventurers (usually without asking).

      # $[objectname]


      The Verdant Wardens are a faction rooted in ancient elven traditions, committed to the protection of nature and the preservation of the natural order in a world long bereft of magic. Membership requires a deep respect for the cycles of nature, the sanctity of life, and the balance between civilization and the wild. Wood elves and High Elves are particularly welcomed, especially those with skills in natural stewardship, survival, or combat against unnatural threats.


      ### Purpose and Presence


      The Verdant Wardens have a small presence in Sunset Spire, where they strive to foster harmony between the city and the surrounding wilderness. Here, they guard against any threats to the natural world—including the remnants of aberrations and other forces that defy the natural order. Their influence extends to the city's Greenward Sanctuary (formerly the City of the Dead) and its carefully tended public gardens, which they protect as sacred places within urban bounds.


      The Wardens maintain two primary outposts in the city and its surrounding lands:


      * ***Glenwarden Villa:*** Located in the Southern Ward, this estate is home to the Wardens' primary enclave within the city. Surrounded by lush, wild gardens and veiled by vines and ivy, Glenwarden Villa serves as both a sanctuary and meeting place for its members. The villa is owned by two ancient families—the Silvas (of the High Elves) and the Eldermorns (a Wood Elf line with roots in the Verdant Forest). Most of the families travel extensively, leaving the estate in the care of Eryndor Mossbranch, a Wood Elf groundskeeper of immense knowledge, and Lady Sylva Eldermorn, a noblewoman skilled in herbcraft and healing.


      * ***The Blossom Grove and Meadery:*** Set in the outer reaches of Undercliff, this orchard and meadery is managed by the Blossomthorn family, a group of Halfling farmers and craftspeople who assist the Wardens in their agricultural efforts. Here lives Marigold Blossomthorn, a skilled herbalist and healer, and her family, who are renowned for their elixirs and herbal meads. The Grove is a place of healing, where members gather in times of need and to receive Marigold’s guidance. Marigold’s youngest daughter, Sorrell, recently went missing, last seen venturing into the depths of Waterdeep’s ancient underways.


      ***Aid and Support from the Verdant Wardens Their aid includes:***


      * Gathered Wisdom: Wardens share information gathered through attunement with nature and discreet observation of the city. Many members can communicate with local animals, who bring news of disturbances in nature.

      * Sanctuary and Care at Glenwarden Villa: Eryndor Mossbranch offers food, rest, and healing to both members and their animals at Glenwarden Villa, a safe haven for weary travelers.

      * A Gift of the Grove: Lady Sylva Eldermorn occasionally bestows a rare blessing, an herbal charm woven from the Grove’s rarest plants, granting temporary resilience or fortitude to a deserving member.


      The Verdant Wardens are dedicated to their mission of protecting what remains of the natural world, respecting the balance of life, and remembering the magic lost long ago. Through their loyalty to the earth and each other, they strive to keep alive the memory of magic’s beauty, acting as guardians of both history and nature.

      To join the Iron Vows, one must first serve with the Bronze Hands, an initial rank within the mercenary company that guards and upholds the law in Sunset Spire. As a professional force for hire, the Iron Vows operate under contract with the city’s ruling lords, defending its citizens, enforcing its laws, and standing watch over its streets. Individuals with past military or mercenary experience, as well as those willing to swear an oath of loyalty to Sunset Spire, may be considered for the Bronze Hands. Adventurers who distinguish themselves in these roles may eventually be invited to join by the Iron Captain, Alara Kade, leader of the Iron Vows.


      The Iron Vows are the elite of this company, a select group of hardened and highly skilled warriors who take on the most dangerous missions for Sunset Spire. Mercenaries don’t begin their careers in the Iron Vows—they must first prove their value within the Bronze Hands. When Sunset Spire faces threats too great for its other forces, the city council contracts the Iron Vows as a last resort. This elite force is known not only for its skill but also for its intensity, sometimes resulting in collateral damage as they handle threats to the city.


      Though the council sets the objectives, Alara Kade personally selects the Iron Vows team for each mission, choosing only those whose skill matches the assignment. If any member of the Iron Vows (or the Bronze Hands) is detained on charges, the council or the Iron Captain often intervenes to negotiate their release, recognizing their loyalty and value to the city.


      ***As part of the Iron Vows, members receive special support:***


      * Detained adventurers are often released under Alara Kade's supervision, with conditions.

      * Temporary access to rare magical items is occasionally granted for difficult missions, though these items tend to disappear when no longer needed.

      * A trusted member of the Iron Vows, such as the veteran Toren Blackforge, may be dispatched to support the team in particularly challenging situations.


      The Iron Vows are a force to be reckoned with—fierce, loyal, and dedicated to protecting Sunset Spire, for the right price.

        The Bronze Hands rose to prominence as Sunset Spire’s city guard following the Great Sundering, a cataclysmic event that erased all magic from the world for a thousand years. Before the Sundering, Sunset Spire had relied on arcane wards, enchanted relics, and magical defenders to protect the city. But with magic gone, these defenses vanished overnight, leaving the city vulnerable to attacks from outside forces and internal unrest.


        At first, Sunset Spire’s ruling council scrambled to replace the city’s lost magical protections. With lawlessness spreading, they urgently needed a skilled fighting force to defend the city walls and respond to external threats. Various local militias attempted to step into the void, but lacking discipline and organization, they often turned on one another. That’s when the Bronze Hands, already a well-established mercenary company, came forward with a proposal: they would become Sunset Spire’s official city guard, defending the city as a contracted force under council authority.


        Iron Captain Alara Kade, the Bronze Hands’ leader, assured the council they could provide a structured, experienced force loyal to the defense of Sunset Spire. Already respected for their rigorous training and expertise in both weaponry and tactics, the Bronze Hands quickly organized patrols, reinforced the city gates, and established a command structure capable of rapidly mobilizing forces against outside threats.


        As they proved their value, the Bronze Hands took on additional responsibilities, such as guarding critical infrastructure and defending trade routes to support the city’s lifeline. Their disciplined approach and visible commitment to the city gradually won over the population. In time, they expanded their ranks with new recruits from all walks of life, instilling in each one a sense of duty that went beyond their origins as a mercenary force.


        Generations later, the Bronze Hands remain Sunset Spire’s primary defenders, having grown from a company of hired fighters to a foundational institution. They are no longer just mercenaries but have become the steadfast city guard, a symbol of resilience that endures even as the Great Sundering becomes a distant memory.The Bronze Hands rose to prominence as Sunset Spire’s city guard following the Great Sundering, a cataclysmic event that erased all magic from the world for a thousand years.

      Anyone may seek to join The Veiled Hand, an infamous and shadowy organization lurking within Sunset Spiral’s underworld. Though it holds no official status, it wields substantial influence in the city’s darker alleys and hidden markets. Membership is only granted after an applicant proves their worth through a serious crime, selected by guild recruiters to test their commitment. Tasks might include eliminating a traitorous guild member, kidnapping a notable Sunset Spiral citizen, extorting a ransom, robbing a merchant’s caravan, or looting a warehouse.


      Among lower-ranking members, there is constant speculation about the true nature of the Veiled Hand’s leader, known only as “The Shade.” Few have ever seen or spoken directly to The Shade, and even fewer have any idea of their true identity. Ruthless and cunning characters find plenty of opportunities to thrive in the Veiled Hand’s brutal hierarchy, where advancement is achieved by removing rivals, often in deadly fashion.

      ***Support from the Veiled Hand:***


      * Monstrous Assistants: Any member assigned a difficult task may receive a monstrous bodyguard or accomplice such as a bugbear, a kenku, or a wererat—who has secret instructions to eliminate the member if they fail.


      * Underground Network: Members gain access to a labyrinth of hidden cellars and tunnels that snake beneath Sunset Spiral, providing safe passage and secure hideouts.


      * The Gazer’s Watch: The Shade may send a small floating spy, called a gazer, to assist and monitor a rising guild member, ensuring their loyalty and reporting back to the leader.


      The Veiled Hand is a place for those willing to gamble their lives for power, riches, and the mysterious influence it offers within Sunset Spiral.

      The Silver Chain


      The Silver Chain is an influential and covert organization in Sunset Spiral, operating with a focus on profit, influence, and strategic alliances. Open to ambitious individuals, the Silver Chain values ingenuity and resilience over strict loyalty. Members trade in mercenaries, rare goods, and even arcane artifacts, aiming to expand their influence within Sunset Spiral. However, the city’s powerful Council of Lords, noble families, and influential guilds have made the Silver Chain’s quest for political power a constant challenge.


      Internally, the organization is fractured. One faction, led by the enigmatic Manshoon, seeks to oust their rival faction, the Veiled Hand, in a bid to seize control over Sunset Spiral’s underground economy and extend their influence into the city’s politics. Opposing them are the Vault Raiders—a group of retired adventurers who have shifted to mercantile pursuits and wish to legitimize the Silver Chain’s operations. The Vault Raiders, named for their history of recovering artifacts from ancient vaults, are striving to build alliances within the city. Manshoon’s war with the Veiled Hand, however, has thrown their careful plans into disarray.


      The Vault Raiders, who view themselves as the true heart of the Silver Chain in Sunset Spiral, are led by Davil Starsong (Master of Negotiations), Istrid Horn (Master of Trade), Skeemo Shadowspark (Master of Magic), Tashlyn Yafeera (Master of Arms and Mercenaries), and Ziraj the Hunter (Master of Silent Operations).


      ***Silver Chain Support:***


      * Noble Connections: Davil can arrange meetings with influential nobles and guild leaders within Sunset Spiral.

      * Exclusive Goods: Skeemo offers discounted potions and rare concoctions at his alchemy shop, Shadowspark Concoctions, in the Market District.

      * Mercenary Services: Tashlyn provides affordable mercenary hires, from thugs at 2 silver per day to veteran guards at 2 gold per day.

      * Loans: Istrid offers loans up to 2,500 gold with a 10% interest rate per tenday, making resources available to trusted allies.

      * Discreet Services: Ziraj is available for covert assignments, accepting payment in the form of a favor to be called upon in the future.


      While shrouded in secrecy, the Silver Chain operates as one of Sunset Spiral’s most quietly influential factions, with both the Vault Raiders and Manshoon’s followers competing for control over the future of the organization and the city.

      Theodore was leerling onder een leermeester schilder genaamd Edouard Manet. Ik ben buiten gegooid omdat ik een betrapt ben tijdens het stelen van een van zijn schilderijen. Theodore is kleptomaan. 


      Dit schildermeester en zijn leerlingen bevonden zich in Aurathal Fields. Theodore uit schaamte voor zijn daden vluchte hij weg naar Sunset Spire om daar een nieuwe carriere te beginnen onder een nieuwe naam, Danksy(dit kan nog veranderen xd).

      Hij lied, naast zijn leermseester Edouard, ook zijn ouders achter uit angs om hun teleur te stellen. Hun naamen zijn Geraldine en Moris Gericault.

      Firbolg 


      barbarian



      38 jaar oud

      Groot met een buikje maar sterke armen

      Bruine ogen, ros wild haar

      Blauwe huidskleur

      Een snor en sikje

      Heeft als wapens een hand held crossbow en een axe

      Draagt een kruidenzakje met zich mee

      Heeft meerdere grote littekens het meest prominente is een litteken die vanuit zijn liphoek naar zijn kaak gaat aan de rechterkant 

      Hij draagt een groene kilt met een riem waar hij allerlei dingen aan kan hangen 

      Laarzen gemaakt van berenpoten

      En dan wat armor op zijn bovenlijf maar zo armor die hem duidelijk niet al te goed past (hij heeft het van een dode genomen)


      Diep in een ongerept woud leefde Pim Pommel Pot samen met zijn firbolg-clan. Het leven in de clan draaide om harmonie met de natuur en het beschermen van hun omgeving. Pim was een belangrijk deel van de gemeenschap. Hij bracht anderen samen, genoot van verhalenavonden en speelde muziek die het hart verwarmde. Daarnaast stond hij bekend als een bekwame genezer, altijd klaar om anderen te helpen.


      Maar die vrede werd abrupt verstoord. Op een nacht werd de clan aangevallen door indringers die niets anders dan verwoesting brachten. Pim kon niet voorkomen dat hij zijn familie en vrienden verloor. Zelf werd hij gevangen genomen, niet om te worden gedood, maar omdat zijn genezende krachten nuttig bleken. De jaren daarna waren zwaar; hij werd vernederd als nar en gedwongen om zijn kennis tegen zijn wil te gebruiken. 


      Het isolement in deze donkere tijd liet diepe sporen na. Waar Pim ooit sociaal en zelfverzekerd was, werd hij stil en teruggetrokken. Hij begon zichzelf af te schermen, bang voor nieuwe pijn. Toch bleef zijn zachte aard intact. Zijn liefde voor dieren en muziek gaf hem kracht om door te gaan.


      Op een nacht, toen de kans zich eindelijk voordeed, wist Pim te ontsnappen. Met slechts een eenvoudige zelf gemaakte fluit en de herinnering aan zijn verloren gemeenschap reisde hij door onbekend terrein. Hij wilde weg van het verleden en hoopte ergens een nieuw begin te vinden.


      Nu reist Pim naar Sunset Pire, een plek vol nieuwe mogelijkheden. Ondanks zijn indrukwekkende kracht als barbaar blijft hij zachtmoedig en geneigd om geweld alleen te gebruiken als het echt niet anders kan. Zijn jarenlange isolatie maken hem sociaal onhandig; hij kan harde dingen zeggen zonder het te bedoelen, en soms trekt hij zich terug als de situatie hem overweldigt. Toch zoekt hij verbinding en probeert hij de warmte en gemeenschap te hervinden die hij ooit kende.


      Pim’s reis is er een van hoop en herstel. Hij streeft ernaar een nieuw thuis te vinden en misschien, heel misschien, weer contact te maken met zijn roots.

        ## The Great Sundering


        Before the Great Sundering, humans in Trotroles were a relatively minor presence in a world dominated by powerful magical beings like the High Elves, Dwarves, and Dragonborn. While these ancient races wielded potent magic and built vast empires, humans lived on the fringes, scattered and largely overlooked. They were nomads, traders, and laborers, contributing to society but never holding much influence.


        When the Sundering hit and magic suddenly disappeared, the once-stable world of Trotroles was thrown into chaos. The cataclysm shattered arcane protections and unleashed terrors from the Underdark, leaving many civilizations vulnerable. For the humans, however, this was both a curse and an unexpected opportunity. Without magic to favor the other races, the playing field was leveled, allowing humans to survive using their adaptability and practical skills.


        **A New Reality**


        With the absence of magic, humans had to fend for themselves in an unpredictable world. Unlike the elves, who lost their powerful enchantments, or the dragonborn, who could no longer draw upon the elemental forces, humans were already accustomed to living without much magical influence. They quickly adapted to the new reality and focused on what they did best: using their ingenuity, resilience, and cooperation to survive.


        **The Rise of Humans in Sunset Spire**


        The city of Sunset Spire, originally built by the High Elves as a grand bastion of magical power, became a shadow of its former glory after the Sundering. As magic faded, the city’s enchantments crumbled, and its once-majestic towers fell into disrepair. The elves retreated, leaving behind a hollowed-out city that became a refuge for various displaced peoples, including humans.


        Humans were among the first to adapt to the shifting dynamics of Sunset Spire. The Guild of Innovators, an organization founded by human engineers and craftspeople, emerged as a key player in the city’s revitalization. By using non-magical technology and practical engineering, they rebuilt sections of the city, restored crumbling infrastructure, and fortified it against threats from the surrounding lands. This pragmatic approach earned them the respect of the other races that had taken refuge there.


        Over the centuries, humans established their presence in Sunset Spire, turning it into a center of trade, innovation, and exploration. They were not the most powerful force in the city, but their ability to adapt and find solutions made them invaluable. The return of magic, however, loomed as both an opportunity and a potential threat to their newfound stability.


        **Cultural Identity**


        During the thousand years without magic, humans developed a distinct cultural identity based on resilience, innovation, and practicality. Unlike other races that lamented the loss of magic, humans thrived in the absence of it. Their culture was centered on the values of:


        * ***Adaptability:*** Humans learned to pivot quickly in the face of adversity, making them highly flexible in dealing with the ever-changing world.

        * ***Ingenuity:*** Without magic, they relied on their creativity and problem-solving skills to survive and rebuild. This led to the development of advanced technologies, from complex pulley systems to early steam-powered engines.

        * ***Community:*** Whether on the plains, at sea, or in the forests, humans understood the value of cooperation and mutual support. This focus on community enabled them to survive when more magically dependent races struggled.


        Their society in Sunset Spire became a patchwork of traditions from the Plainsfolk, Mariners, and Forest Clans, blending their ancestral skills and beliefs into a unique, pragmatic culture that was always prepared for the next challenge.


        **Symbols**


        * ***The Ashen Oak:*** A tree with roots entwined with stone, symbolizing the Forest Clans’ ability to endure even when magic was lost. The oak represents resilience and the strength to grow in the harshest conditions.

        * ***The Nomad's Lantern:*** A brass lantern, always lit, representing the Plainsfolk’s guiding light through the darkest of times. It symbolizes hope, guidance, and the pursuit of a better future even in the absence of magic.

        * ***The Iron Trident:*** A weapon symbol representing both strength and adaptability. It is a nod to the Coastal Mariners who ruled the seas, wielding the trident to defend their communities from sea monsters and pirates alike.


        ## Human Traits


        **Ability Score Increase**Your ability scores each increase by 1.


        **Age**Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.


        **Size**

        Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.


        **Speed**Your base walking speed is 30 feet.


        **Languages**You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

            Volo for short, was a widely traveled human wizard and sage. He was a legendary traveler, explorer, and rogueish mage, and was most famous, or infamous, for his guidebooks including the controversial and notorious Volo's Guide to All Things Magical.



            Volo was also known to have an acid tongue and to be quite verbose, even bombastic, but overly honest and mocking. Elminster remarked he'd "never met anyone who can hang himself with his own tongue as effectively as old Volo." Yet he nevertheless had some charms.


            Despite his flaws, however, Volo was soft at heart and he cared for his friends most of all, at least those friends he had. He would do anything he could to aid them.


            Volo himself claimed to have restless feet and a love of travel, of seeing new things and living life to the full, though his may just have been an excuse for his forced journeys. He considered anything outside the towns and cities to be boring and hazardous. He much preferred the setting of a pleasant tavern or festhall to trekking through a jungle, ruins, or dungeon, and he tended to indulge himself.

            Alara is a capable wizard in her mid-thirties, the youngest person ever to hold the position of @[](ssasrhxmmu). As the High Wizard of Sunset spire, she is charged with using all the magic and resources at her disposal to defend the city against threats . She was handpicked for the job by Khelben Arunsun, and wields the Blackstaff from which Khelben derived his name and the title of the office. 


            Alara isn't the city's most powerful wizard, but she can hold her own. Despite her many gifts, she still questions her ability to meet the demands of her role, and she rarely makes a decision without first soliciting the advice of the Blackstaff, which contains Khelben Arunsun's spirit as well as the spirits of all the other Blackstaffs who preceded her. 


            She also gets intelligence from many other sources, both through her own network of spies and from Harper agents. Vajra runs Blackstaff Academy, a school for mages, out of Blackstaff Tower in the Castle Ward. She is also in charge of Iron vows, Vajra is always looking for new adventurers to fill the ranks of the iron vows, and she is particularly interested in those who can bring unique skills, abilities, or spells to the mix. 


            Several of the old er and more seasoned wizards in sunset spire consider Vajra an upstart, but they are smart enough not to challenge her. Only the Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. can strip Vajra of her title.

        ## Backstories


        **The Great Sundering**


        The Great Sundering was a cataclysmic event that tore the fabric of magic from the world of Trotroles. For a thousand years, arcane energies that once held civilizations together were abruptly lost, plunging the world into chaos. For the dwarves, this upheaval was especially devastating. Cut off from their enchanted forges and protective wards, their mountain fortresses became increasingly vulnerable. The rise of monstrous creatures from the Underdark, no longer deterred by ancient magical barriers, led to an exodus from the dwarven holds. As the lands grew too perilous, the dwarves turned to the seas in search of new resources and safety.


        **A New Reality**


        Forced to abandon the depths of their mountain homes, the dwarves adapted quickly to a world without magic. They repurposed their engineering prowess to create vast medieval oil rigs along the coastlines of Trotroles. These colossal structures, known as Iron Spires, allowed them to mine resources deep beneath the ocean floor, where they believed the remnants of the world's lost magic might be hidden. Though they could no longer rely on enchanted tools, the dwarves innovated with steam engines, pulley systems, and metalcraft, ensuring their survival amidst the changing tides of a magic-less world.


        **The Sea Miners of Trotroles**


        The dwarves of Trotroles became known as the Sea Miners, masters of extracting rare minerals and metals from beneath the seabed. Their floating rigs are both fortress and home, built with towering cranes, intricate winches, and labyrinthine networks of platforms. The dwarves’ ingenuity allowed them to craft underwater mining devices capable of withstanding the crushing pressure of the depths. These rigs are self-sustaining, with fishing nets, desalination devices, and hydroponic gardens that keep the communities afloat and thriving.


        To protect themselves from marauding sea monsters, pirates, and the ever-present threat of the Underdark spilling into coastal waters, the dwarves forged alliances with seafaring humans and elves. These partnerships ensured mutual protection, trade, and shared knowledge of navigating the perilous waters of Trotroles.


        **Cultural Identity**


        Living on the sea has significantly reshaped the cultural identity of the dwarves. Once proud of their mountain homes, they have now embraced the vast, unpredictable ocean as their new domain. They are known for their resilience, adaptability, and camaraderie, forged in the harsh conditions of the Iron Spires. A typical dwarf of the sea is an expert in mechanics, shipbuilding, and deep-sea mining. Their culture values independence, but also the unity of their rig communities, where every member plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and prosperity of the floating city.


        Their traditional songs and stories have shifted from tales of mountain conquest to epic sea voyages and battles against colossal sea creatures. Festivals on the rigs celebrate the triumph over the wild seas, with feasts of freshly caught fish and potent brews distilled from seaweed. Despite the drastic changes in their way of life, the dwarves maintain their deep love for craftsmanship, albeit now focused on maritime technology.


        **Symbols**


        * ***The Iron Anchor:*** Represents stability and resilience amidst the ever-changing tides. It’s often engraved on their tools, banners, and ship prows.


        * ***The Black Pearl:*** A rare gemstone found in the depths, it has become a symbol of luck and prosperity. Dwarves often wear it as a pendant or set in rings.


        * ***The Sea Lantern:*** A glowing blue crystal that guides ships through fog and darkness. It represents hope and guidance for dwarves lost at sea.

          ## Backstory


          **The Great Sundering:**


          It came without warning. One night, as the twin moons rose high over Eldergrove, a shiver of cold silence swept through the city. Ancient oaks that had flourished for centuries withered in moments, their life force vanishing like mist in the sunlight. The air, once thick with the hum of magic, fell still, and an unfamiliar darkness blanketed the land.


          The Sundering, as it would come to be called, was more than the loss of magic; it was the loss of identity. The High Elves were thrown into turmoil, cut off from the Feywild and the mystical currents they had always known. The grand towers of @[](hynbktnjnj), once thriving with fae energy, began to crack and crumble. Despair set in, for their people felt not only the absence of their magical powers but also a profound separation from their very souls.


          In the midst of the chaos, Sylvarius, the Keeper of the Verdant Realm, stood as a beacon of hope. His wise counsel and unshakable resolve kept the High Elves from descending into complete despair. Side by side with King @[](iwlvxkqkyr), the Wood Elf ruler who held sway over the Verdant Forest, @[](kloojyvcdx) guided the broken High Elves and Wood Elves alike, instructing them on how to survive in this new world bereft of magic.


          **A New Reality:**


          Life in @[](hynbktnjnj) was no longer sustainable, and after a century of clinging to their hollowed city, the High Elves reluctantly abandoned it. @[](kloojyvcdx) and @[](iwlvxkqkyr) led a solemn procession through the dying lands of their once-great realm, seeking refuge where they could begin anew. Their search brought them to the fertile plains of @[](kbqlqbxohx), a humble region near the forest where the earth was rich and the sun warmed the soil. Though it lacked the majesty of @[](hynbktnjnj), it offered something the High Elves desperately needed: stability.


          The High Elves faced a daunting challenge. They had to learn the ways of farming, something so foreign to them that it felt as if they were betraying their own heritage. They planted seeds instead of weaving life from magic, coaxed harvests from the earth with sweat instead of spellwork, and tended crops under the hot sun. Over time, they grew skilled at this new way of life, forging relationships with the natural world that were grounded in practicality rather than enchantment.


          As they labored, the elves began to take pride in their new identity, becoming known as the Farmers of Trotroles. They taught their children to till the soil, to respect the changing seasons, and to cherish the bounty of the earth. Though their loss still ached, this close connection to nature rekindled a measure of their old wonder, albeit in a more grounded form.


          **The Farmers of Trotroles:**


          The Farmers of Trotroles developed a distinct culture, merging the elegance of their lost heritage with the simple, hearty traditions of the land. Each planting season, they would gather to honor the memory of the Feywild, sowing seeds with small rites and songs that echoed their past. This gave rise to the @[](gcsfizoqvg), where elves, now garbed in humble yet beautiful linen, would honor their ancestors and celebrate the resilience of their people.


          Their farms were lush and diverse. They grew everything from golden grains to colorful vegetables, each crop chosen for its hardiness as well as its beauty. Trotroles became famous for the Elf Wheat—a high-yield crop that grew in the gentle sunlight of the plains and was prized for its soft, golden hue. The wheat symbolized the High Elves’ transformation from ethereal beings to hardworking folk of the earth.


          **Cultural Identity:**


          The Cultural Identity of the High Elves of Trotroles is one of transformation and grounded beauty. Once bound to magic and the ethereal Feywild, they now find strength in the earth, crafting lives of simplicity and purpose. Reverence for the natural world is central, honoring the cycles of the seasons and the quiet resilience of the land. Their once-grand rituals are now humble, yet deeply cherished—reminders of a lost past woven into the fabric of their daily lives.


          They cherish hard work, communal bonds, and harmony with the animals they raise, seeing themselves as stewards of the land. Through craftsmanship and farming, they blend the elegance of their heritage with practicality, celebrating beauty in even the simplest of tools and garments. This community of farmers finding magic not in spells but in the lives they nurture and the land they call home.



          ***Symbols:***

          * Elf Wheat: Represents the High Elves’ transformation and adaptability; it is seen as a symbol of sustenance and growth.


          * The Verdant Oak: Though Eldergrove’s trees have withered, small groves of these sacred oaks still exist, their branches used to carve staffs and adorn homes, reminding the elves of their past.


          * Silverleaf Amulets: These small, silver charms are worn by nearly every High Elf, symbolizing resilience, wisdom, and their connection to nature and the lost Feywild.

          ## Backstory

          **The Great Sundering**


          In an age long past, magic flowed through the world like a river, infusing every living thing with life and power. The wood elves, led by @[](iwlvxkqkyr), thrived in this enchanted realm, their connection to nature and magic allowing them to perform incredible feats—summoning storms, healing the wounded, and communicating with the very essence of the forest.


          **A New Reality**


          With the disappearance of magic, the wood elves faced a harsh new reality. No longer able to rely on their mystical abilities, they had to adapt to survive. Aranathor, witnessing the pain of his people and the desolation of their homeland, recognized the need for a new path. He called upon his kin to embrace their innate skills as hunters and scouts, leveraging their knowledge of the woods and their unparalleled agility.


          **The Hunters of Trotroles**


          The elves transformed, honing their skills in stealth, tracking, and survival. They became expert hunters, gathering resources and food from the forest while remaining vigilant guardians of their land. They developed new techniques, using their deep understanding of nature to create traps and camouflage, becoming masters of stealth and strategy.


          **The Scouts of Trotroles**


          As time passed, the wood elves’ skills grew so refined that they became known beyond their own borders. Lords, Mercenary, and leaders sought their aid as scouts, spies, and emissaries. The wood elves, with their unmatched ability to navigate forests, mountains, and plains undetected, became the eyes and ears of the world’s rulers. But while they served other kingdoms, their loyalty always remained with the wilds. They acted as protectors of the natural world, and their work as scouts ensured that they could monitor the lands beyond their forests.**their mission:* to preserve the balance between civilization and nature.


          ***Symbols:***

          * The Veiled Eye: This eye-shaped symbol, covered by a flowing leaf, represents the wood elves’ skill in stealth and their role as unseen watchers of the land. The "veiled" aspect signifies both the elves' hidden presence and their deep insight into the natural and civilized worlds.


          * The Cloak of Leaves: Made from specially treated and woven leaves from the forest, this cloak is both camouflage and a tribute to their homeland. The leaves are bound together with fine threads, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, and are treated to remain evergreen, symbolizing the forest's eternal presence.


          * The Twining Branch and Arrow: Representing the union of natural prowess and martial skill, the arrow entwined with a living branch symbolizes the elves’ transition from wielding magic to mastering survival and hunting. It is a reminder of their adaptability and their oath to protect the forest through skill and strategy.

            ### Backstory of Aranathor


            **Name:** Aranathor, King of the Woods


            **Background:**

            Aranathor was born into a long line of noble elves, each known for their deep connection to the forests of Eldoria. From a young age, he displayed an innate understanding of the natural world, often seen playing among the ancient trees and befriending woodland creatures. His parents, both respected leaders, instilled in him a sense of duty to protect the realm's rich heritage.


            **Ascension to Kingship:**

            After the tragic passing of his father, Aranathor stepped into the role of leader at a young age. His ascension was met with skepticism, as many doubted the wisdom of one so young. However, he quickly proved his worth by uniting various elven clans against a looming threat from dark sorcerers seeking to corrupt the forests for their own gain. His charisma and deep love for the woods inspired his people to rally around him.


            **Vision and Governance:**

            As king, Aranathor prioritized the restoration of the forest and the protection of its magic. He established the Council of Elders, comprising wise druids and guardians, to advise him and ensure the preservation of their sacred lands. Under his leadership, the kingdom flourished, and the bond between the elves and nature grew stronger.


            **Conflict and Resolution:**

            Aranathor faced numerous challenges, including invasions from neighboring realms and internal dissent. Through diplomacy, courage, and strategic alliances, he navigated these conflicts, often venturing into the heart of the forest to commune with ancient spirits for guidance. His ability to harness the power of nature in battle became legendary, with tales of him calling upon the trees to entrap foes or summoning animals to aid his warriors.


            **Legacy:**

            Aranathor is remembered as a wise and just ruler, deeply revered by his people. His legacy is one of balance, emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature. He established the Festival of the Green, an annual celebration honoring the forest and its gifts, ensuring that future generations would continue to cherish the woods. Today, statues of Aranathor stand in glades across Eldoria, symbols of the enduring bond between the elves and their beloved realm.

          ## Backstory


          **The Great Sundering:** 


          Once a powerful and magical race, the sea elves faced a cataclysmic event known as the Great Sundering, which severed their deep connection to the arcane forces that had defined their existence. As magic faded from the world, their vibrant societies crumbled, and they were forced to adapt to a harsh new reality, one where their enchanting abilities were replaced with resilience and ingenuity.


          **A New Reality:** 


          In the wake of the Great Sundering, the sea elves forged a new identity rooted in the physical world rather than the mystical. They turned their backs on the grandiosity of their past, embracing the ebb and flow of life by the ocean. Their culture evolved into one focused on survival, community, and commerce, reflecting the practical skills they honed in response to their changing circumstances. No longer bound by the limitations of magic, the sea elves learned to navigate the challenges of their environment with skill and resourcefulness.


          **The Fishers:**

           As fishermen, the sea elves have become masters of the ocean’s bounty. Their methods are sustainable and respectful, honoring the spirits of the sea and ensuring that future generations can thrive. They have developed intricate techniques for catching fish and harvesting sea plants, often working in harmony with the tides. Each fishing expedition is both a practical endeavor and a cultural ritual, filled with songs and stories that connect them to their ancestors and the natural world.

          **The Sea Merchants:**

           In addition to fishing, sea elves have embraced their role as merchants, establishing vibrant trade networks along the coasts and across the waters.Their ships are a testament to their craftsmanship, designed for both speed and elegance, allowing them to navigate the trade routes with ease. The sea elves have cultivated relationships with neighboring communities, becoming respected traders who bring rare goods and valuable knowledge from the depths of the ocean.

          **Cultural Identity:** 

          The sea elves are a people of grace and resilience, their physical appearances reflecting the colors of the ocean—shimmering blues, vibrant greens, and soft sand hues. Their attire is practical yet beautifully adorned, often embellished with shells and marine motifs that celebrate their connection to the sea. Their society is built on cooperation and respect for nature, with rituals and festivals that honor the ocean’s cycles and the spirits of their ancestors.


          ***Symbols:***


          * The Moonfish: Known for its grace and luminescent glow in the water, the moonfish is an important symbol in sea elf culture. They believe the moonfish embodies guidance and wisdom, often associating it with ancestors who “illuminate” paths forward. Many sea elves wear moonfish amulets or embroider its likeness onto clothing as a reminder of their connection to past generations and their responsibility to future ones.


          * The Tide Shell:

          This is a distinctive shell, unique in its shimmering hues of blues and greens, symbolizing the resilience and adaptive spirit of the sea elves. The shell is often carved or etched with intricate patterns by artisans, making it a cherished object of both practical and spiritual significance. Passed down through families or given as a rite-of-passage gift, the Tide Shell represents their connection to the ocean and the enduring legacy of their ancestors.


          * The Sea Spiral:

          The spiral, resembling the whirl of the ocean’s currents, is a recurring symbol in sea elf art and architecture. It represents the cycle of life, change, and adaptability, a reminder of their survival after the Great Sundering. The sea spiral can be seen woven into textiles, painted on ships, and even worn as body art, symbolizing how their culture flows and endures.

          blurb: "# $[objectname]\n\nThe lord of House Valcaryne, Marcellus, is a strikingly handsome half-elf known for his charm, wealth, and influence in Sunset Spire. Beneath his polished exterior lies a dark secret: Marcellus and his wife, Elaria, have secured their wealth and power through a pact with the archdevil Asmodeus. The price? The souls of their three children.\n\nMarcellus, a secret priest of Asmodeus, hides his true allegiance behind a flawless façade. To the people of Sunset Spire, he is a respected financier, generous philanthropist, and devoted follower of Aurelin, the goddess of light and hope. A portion of his fortune goes toward funding shelters and feeding the city's poor, further cementing his image as a benevolent noble. Yet behind the scenes, Marcellus pursues only his own gain, his philanthropy serving as a convenient mask for his devilish dealings.\n\nThe soul of his eldest son, Caladorn, is already lost, a permanent casualty of his infernal bargain. Wracked with guilt but driven by desperation, Marcellus has devised a plan to save the souls of his twins, Alandra and Tristain. According to the terms of the contract, their souls will belong to Asmodeus on their ninth birthdays, which are swiftly approaching. However, Marcellus can avert this fate by fulfilling the contract's sinister conditions: offering \"one shy of a million gold coins and the sacrifice of one shy of a hundred innocent souls.\"\n\nMarcellus is intelligent, suave, and almost unflappable, his every move calculated to maintain his influence and cover his true intentions. He enjoys excellent health, an unnaturally long life, and immunity to disease as a result of his pact. Always dressed in the latest fashion, Marcellus carries a golden-tipped cane adorned with emeralds. Though it serves as a status symbol, the cane is far more than ornamental—it is a powerful magical rod of rulership.\n\nDespite his polished demeanor, Marcellus Valcaryne is a man of ruthless ambition, willing to sacrifice everything and everyone to secure his family’s power and save what remains of his own bloodline.\n\n![](https://www.worldanvil.com/uploads/images/4d8c316c151bc5f6dc493b0cb752e548.jpg)\n\n*Medium humanoid (half-elf) , Lawful Evil*\n\n----\n\n**Armor Class** 15\n\n**Hit Points** 97 (15d8 + 30) \n\n**Speed** 30ft\n\n------\n\n**Saving Throws** CON +6, WIS +7\n\n**Skills** History +7, Insight +7, Persuasion +8, Religion +7\n\n**Damage Immunities** Poison\n\n**Condition Immunities** Poisoned\n\n**Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 13\n\n**Languages** Common, Draconic, Elvish, Infernal\n\n**Challenge** 10\n\n-----\n\n***Marcellus is a 15th-level spellcaster.*** His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks).

        ## Backstorie


        **The Great Sundering**


        The Great Sundering was a devastating event that severed magic from the world of Trotroles for a thousand years. For the Firbolgs, who had long depended on their druidic magic to protect their hidden forest sanctuaries and to commune with the spirits of nature, it was a catastrophic blow. Without their magical defenses, the Firbolg settlements were laid bare, vulnerable to monstrous creatures emerging from the Underdark and the marauding bands that roamed the land. In the chaos that followed, many Firbolg clans were wiped out, unable to defend themselves against these relentless threats. Only a handful of clans survived, retreating deeper into the most remote corners of the world.


        **A New Reality**


        The once-thriving Firbolg race became nearly extinct, with only a few scattered clans managing to survive the Sundering’s aftermath. The loss of magic forced them to adapt quickly, relying entirely on their ancestral knowledge of herbs, plants, and the natural world. The surviving Firbolgs became elusive and secretive, rarely seen by outsiders. They constructed hidden sanctuaries in dense forests, high hills, and mist-shrouded valleys, fortified by natural barriers and clever camouflage.


        These remnants of the Firbolg race focused their energies on becoming skilled herbalists and healers, using their deep connection to the land to sustain themselves and heal those in need. Their settlements are few and far between, each clan consisting of no more than a dozen members. These small groups have made it their mission to preserve what remains of their once-great culture while continuing their sacred duty as protectors of nature.


        **The Healers of Trotroles**


        The few surviving Firbolgs have embraced a new role as the Healers of Trotroles, becoming wandering caretakers in a world that desperately needs them. Known for their unmatched knowledge of herbal medicine, they have become legends among other races—whispered tales speak of Firbolg healers appearing in the dead of night to tend to the sick and wounded, only to vanish before dawn. These elusive healers rarely reveal their identities, fearful of drawing the attention of those who might seek to exploit them.


        These Firbolgs are not only healers but also guardians of the few remaining untouched wilds of Trotroles. They continue to gather rare herbs and plants, using their extensive knowledge to create powerful potions, salves, and remedies that can cure ailments no ordinary physician can treat. However, they have grown wary of outsiders, offering their aid only to those who show respect for the natural world.


        **Cultural Identity**


        The Firbolgs’ culture has changed drastically since the Sundering. Once a thriving, clan-based society, they are now on the brink of extinction, with only a few clans surviving in isolation. The Firbolgs who remain are intensely protective of their dwindling numbers and hidden homes. Family bonds are sacred, and the loss of even a single clan member is mourned deeply. Their settlements, hidden deep within forests or on remote hilltops, are fortified with natural barriers and traps to keep out intruders.


        Their way of life is centered on self-sufficiency and preservation. Firbolgs have reverted to a hunter-gatherer existence, living off the land with careful stewardship. They only take what they need, storing resources to sustain themselves during harsh winters. These remaining clans pass down their knowledge of herbal medicine, natural remedies, and forest lore to the younger members, ensuring their wisdom is not lost.


        **Symbols**


        * ***The Hidden Grove:*** Depicting a dense forest encircled by protective thorns, this symbol represents their hidden sanctuaries and their role as guardians of nature. Often carved into the entrances of their hidden homes.


        * ***The Shattered Leaf:*** A symbol representing the Sundering and the near-destruction of their people. It is worn as a reminder of their tragic history and resilience.


        * ***The Healers’ Amulet: Symbol of the Firbolgs’ Survival*** The Healers’ Amulet is a small, intricately crafted pendant made of petrified wood and polished greenstone. It is carved into the shape of a shattered leaf, split into two halves that remain connected by delicate silver threads, symbolizing the survival of the Firbolgs after the Sundering. Embedded within the leaf is a glowing amber gemstone, representing the last flicker of their magic and healing abilities.

        **Use and Abilities:**

        * When worn, this amulet grants its bearer increased knowledge of herbal remedies, allowing them to identify rare plants and craft potent healing potions.

        * Once per day, it can be used to cast “Cure Wounds” (2nd level), drawing on the ancient herbal knowledge of the Firbolgs.

        ## Backstorie


        **The Great Sundering:**


        A thousand years ago, the Great Sundering drained Trotroles of all magic, severing the world's connection to the Feywild. Creatures tied to that mystical realm, including the elusive Changelings, vanished from the mortal plane. They became mere myths, tales passed down through generations, remembered only as tricksters who could steal faces and identities with a blink of an eye.


        **A New Reality:**


        With magic's chaotic return after a millennium, Trotroles was thrust into upheaval. Unstable surges of arcane energy tore open portals to the Feywild, allowing creatures from that vibrant, ever-changing realm to spill into the mortal world. Among them were the Changelings, returning to a land that had all but forgotten them.


        But the world they re-entered was one of turmoil. City states teetered on the brink, and monsters and ancient threats that had been dormant began to stir once more. The Changelings, with their shapeshifting abilities and knack for deception, found themselves in a unique position to take advantage of this instability. Adopting disguises, they infiltrated the courts of nobles, the guilds of merchants, and even the criminal underworld, seeking opportunities to gain influence and power in this reshaped world.


        **An Unknown Destiny in Trotroles:**


        Unlike their ancestors, who had lived in the Feywild, the Changelings now find themselves in a world where magic is unpredictable and often dangerous. This new reality has left their purpose unclear. Are they here to reclaim a lost place in Trotroles, to conquer its chaotic landscape, or simply to survive? Even the Changelings themselves are uncertain of their destiny.


        Some Changelings see this return as an opportunity to carve out a new future, while others are content to remain hidden, observing and influencing events from the shadows. The more ambitious among them form secretive factions, plotting to reshape Trotroles in ways that suit their hidden agendas. Yet there are also those who wander alone, haunted by memories of the Feywild, unsure of where they truly belong in this fractured world.


        **Cultural Identity:**


        The Changelings who have entered Trotroles are a fractured and secretive group. Without a unifying purpose, they navigate the world using their supernatural ability to assume new forms, blending seamlessly into society. Their culture revolves around adaptability and the art of deception, with each Changeling choosing their own path in this uncertain world. They value cunning, secrecy, and above all, the freedom to reinvent themselves at will.


        Their lack of a unified direction has created an unpredictable network of individuals who may cooperate or betray one another, depending on their personal goals. Despite this, they share an unspoken bond as remnants of the Feywild, driven by the desire to carve out a place in Trotroles, whatever that may mean for each of them.


        **Symbols:**


        * ***The Echoing Eye*** An eye with a double iris, one inside the other, surrounded by concentric rings that resemble ripples on water. It’s often etched with a subtle glow-in-the-dark ink.  Represents hidden knowledge, observation, and the ability to see through deception. It’s used as a warning mark for those who are under Changeling watch or as a signature left behind after a successful infiltration.


        * ***The Shifting Sigil***An intricate spiral pattern that seems to change shape depending on the angle it’s viewed from. The design appears fluid, as though it's constantly in motion, yet it is made of solid lines.This symbolizes the Changeling’s nature of perpetual change and adaptability. It’s often engraved on small trinkets or hidden in jewelry to signal their presence to other Changelings without revealing their identity.


        * ***The Flicker Dagger*** A stylized, slender dagger with a blade that appears to be partially transparent or fading into mist. The hilt is adorned with swirling patterns resembling flowing water or smoke. When carved or painted, the blade is depicted with a faint shimmer, almost as if it’s disappearing.

For centuries, they maintained the delicate balance between the mortal world and the planes of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. With their innate connection to ancient dragon magic, they protected Trotroles from elemental threats and ensured the safe flow of magical energy into the world.\n\nHowever, everything changed when the Great Sundering occurred. In an instant, magic — the lifeblood of the Dragonborn’s culture — vanished. The Elemental Gates, which had once pulsed with power, collapsed into chaotic voids. Without their magic to stabilize these portals, cataclysmic forces erupted, devastating nearby regions. The Dragonborn, who had dedicated their lives to this sacred duty, found themselves powerless and adrift in a world that no longer needed their protection.\n\n**A New Reality**\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sundering, the Dragonborn suffered a tragic decline. Stripped of their magical prowess, many of their once-great citadels crumbled, and their skyships fell from the skies like broken stars. The collapse of the Elemental Gates not only severed their mystical connection but also left their Islands barren and inhospitable. Entire clans were wiped out as they struggled to adapt to a harsh new world without the magic that had defined them.\n\nThe Dragonborn who survived became wanderers, scattered across Trotroles. No longer the proud protectors they once were, they became mercenaries, traders, and nomads, searching for purpose in a world that had moved on without them. Over the centuries, the memory of their ancient duty faded into legend, and the surviving Dragonborn became rare, isolated remnants of a forgotten age.\n\n**The Old Guardians of the Elemental Gates of Trotroles**\n\nThe Dragonborn who once served as guardians of the Elemental Gates were part of an elite order known as the Scales of Eternity. This order was divided into four factions, each dedicated to a specific element: Flamekeepers for Fire, Stormwardens for Air, Deepstone for Earth, and Tidecallers for Water. These factions were renowned for their mastery of their respective elements and their unwavering commitment to maintaining the balance between the planes.\n\nWith the loss of magic, the Scales of Eternity disbanded, and the Dragonborn clans who served them faded into obscurity. Now, in the present day, whispers have begun to spread that the Elemental Gates are stirring again, as unstable bursts of magic surge through Trotroles. The surviving Dragonborn, few in number, are haunted by their former duty and wonder if they are destined to reclaim their lost legacy — or face extinction.\n\n**Cultural Identity**\n\nDespite their diminished numbers, the Dragonborn of Trotroles retain a strong sense of honor, duty, and resilience. They continue to uphold their ancient traditions, even if they no longer have the magical power to perform the rituals that once defined them. Storytelling and the preservation of their history have become sacred practices, with elders recounting tales of the Elemental Gates and the legendary guardians who once kept them safe.\n\nModern Dragonborn focus on martial prowess, honing their combat skills to make up for their lack of magic. They believe that the return of magic may one day restore their place as protectors of the world, and they train tirelessly to be ready if that day comes. For now, they are known as skilled warriors, honorable mercenaries, and fierce defenders of their few remaining strongholds.\n\n**Symbols**\n\n* ***The Elemental Sigil:*** A circular emblem divided into four quadrants, each representing Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. It symbolizes their ancient duty to balance the elemental planes and their hope that they may one day reclaim this role.\n* ***The Eternal Flame Sword:*** A finely crafted sword wreathed in engraved flames, symbolizing their undying spirit and readiness to fight. It is a symbol of the Flamekeepers and is carried by Dragonborn warriors as a mark of honor.\n* ***The Celestial Compass:*** A relic used by the Dragonborn navigators of old to find their way through magical storms. It now represents their search for purpose in a world where their original duties have been lost.\n \n"

        ## The Great Sundering & The Return of Magic

        For a thousand years after the Great Sundering, magic in the world of Trotroles was a fading memory. The cataclysmic event that severed the flow of magic from the land left it scarred, filled with creatures that roamed the depths and made travel and trade near impossible. When magic suddenly returned after a millennium, it did so in unpredictable surges, tearing open portals to the mysterious Feywild.


        From these shimmering rifts stepped the Harengon — agile, rabbit-like humanoids with an innate connection to the magic of the Feywild. Drawn by the strange and unstable energies swirling through Trotroles, the Harengon saw the world not as a broken land, but as a realm brimming with untapped potential.


        ## The Leap into Trotroles


        When the Harengon first emerged from the Feywild, they were struck by the vast, water-covered world of Trotroles. Having thrived in the whimsical, ever-changing lands of the Feywild, the Harengon were quick to adapt to their new surroundings. They were explorers at heart, and the scattered islands of Trotroles — each with its own unique ecosystems and resources — were a new playground for their adventurous spirit.


        The Harengon wasted no time. Within days of their arrival, they began hopping from island to island, scouting for the best locations to establish footholds. They were determined to make Trotroles their new home, seeing its wild and untamed nature as an opportunity rather than a challenge. Unlike the chaotic magic of their homeland, the world of Trotroles offered the Harengon a place to build something stable and lasting.


        ## Settlements and Fortifications


        The Harengon were pragmatic settlers. Upon discovering the remnants of ancient ruins on several islands, they quickly repurposed these structures into fortified settlements. They chose strategic locations, often on elevated cliffs or secluded coves, to protect themselves from the unpredictable storms and potential threats lurking in the seas.


        One of their most significant settlements was established on a smaller island just east of Suncrest. This island, now known as Bramblehop Isle, became their first stronghold. Using their natural agility and keen senses, the Harengon constructed watchtowers and palisades, allowing them to keep a vigilant eye on the seas. Their structures, though hastily built, were surprisingly resilient, showcasing their knack for quickly adapting to their environment.


        ## The Harengon's Vision for Trotroles


        Unlike other races that were worn down by the chaos following the Sundering, the Harengon approached Trotroles with boundless optimism. They saw the world as a land of potential — a place where their people could build a prosperous future. The Harengon quickly became skilled navigators and explorers, using their natural speed and agility to traverse the islands and establish trade routes.


        They focused on building a network of settlements, fortified trading posts, and hidden docks to facilitate movement between their colonies. By leveraging their Feywild heritage, they crafted enchantments that protected their outposts, ensuring that even the harshest winters and marauding sea monsters would not drive them away.


        ## Cultural Identity


        The Harengon’s identity in Trotroles is shaped by their Feywild roots and their spirit of adventure. They are a resilient people who refuse to be bogged down by adversity. To the Harengon, the world is a game waiting to be explored, and they approach it with a lighthearted yet determined attitude.


        Their settlements are vibrant, filled with colorful banners, whimsical decorations, and music that echoes through the air. Despite the fortifications, their homes exude a sense of cheer and warmth, a stark contrast to the somber ruins left by the Sundering.

        ## Before the Great Sundering


        Long before the Great Sundering, the orcs of Trotroles were known not for their prowess in battle, but for their strength as skilled craftsmen and woodworkers. Scattered along the dense forests of northern Aurora’s Reach on Sunderlis Isle, these orcs had a deep reverence for the land. Unlike the warlike tribes of other realms, the orcs of Trotroles devoted themselves to the mastery of timber, thriving in the lush woodlands that surrounded them. The towering conifers and resilient hardwoods of their homeland became the foundation of their society.


        Living alongside the gnomes, with whom they shared their northern lands, the orcs developed a strong alliance. The gnomes, with their knack for mechanics and intricate designs, complemented the orcs’ raw strength and woodworking skills. Together, they formed a mutually beneficial partnership, turning the bountiful forests into a source of livelihood and prosperity.


        ## The Great Sundering


        When the Great Sundering struck and magic vanished from the world, the orcs’ way of life was thrown into disarray. Cut off from the ancient rituals that once protected their lands, the orcs and their gnome allies found themselves increasingly isolated as monsters from the Underdark began to emerge.


        Instead of retreating into hiding, the orcs leaned on their craftsmanship to survive. They fortified their villages, building defensive timber palisades and watchtowers, using their unparalleled skills to protect their homes from the encroaching darkness. Recognizing that land travel had become too perilous, the orcs and gnomes looked to the sea as a new path forward.


        ## A New Reality: Birth of the Timberfleet


        With overland routes infested by dangerous creatures, the orcs and gnomes realized that they needed a new way to transport goods, explore, and protect their settlements. Thus, they turned their combined expertise toward the art of shipbuilding. The result was the birth of the Timberfleet, a shipbuilding imbuement that would define the future of their people.


        The orcs’ strength in felling trees, combined with the gnomes’ intricate designs, led to the creation of some of the most durable and efficient ships in Trotroles. These vessels were built to withstand harsh storms, treacherous waves, and the cold northern seas. They used specialized ironwood from Aurora’s Reach forests, making the ships both strong and lightweight.


        The Timberfleet not only provided a means of survival but also allowed the orcs and gnomes to prosper. As trade over land became nearly impossible, their ships became essential for transporting goods between the scattered islands of Trotroles. The northern port village of Aurorengard became the hub of this new industry, bustling with orcs shaping timber and gnomes fitting ships with intricate mechanisms.


        ## The Rise of Orc-Gnome Shipwrights


        As the Timberfleet gained fame, the orcs of Trotroles were no longer seen merely as rugged woodsmen. They became master shipbuilders, sought after by traders and explorers across the islands. Orc clans like the Ironbark and Stormfist specialized in large trading vessels and sturdy fishing boats, while gnomes crafted navigational tools and innovative sails that allowed for faster voyages.


        The Sea-Rider Festival became an annual celebration, where new ships were launched, and the best shipwrights were honored. This partnership between the orcs and gnomes led to a golden age of maritime trade, allowing them to exchange goods with distant islands, explore uncharted waters, and even fend off pirates.


        ## The Orcs of Trotroles: Guardians of the Timber and Masters of Craft

        Before the Great Sundering

        Long before the Great Sundering, the orcs of Trotroles were known not for their prowess in battle, but for their strength as skilled craftsmen and woodworkers. Scattered along the dense forests of northern Aurora’s Reach on Sunderlis Isle, these orcs had a deep reverence for the land. Unlike the warlike tribes of other realms, the orcs of Trotroles devoted themselves to the mastery of timber, thriving in the lush woodlands that surrounded them. The towering conifers and resilient hardwoods of their homeland became the foundation of their society.


        ## Cultural Identity


        The orcs of Trotroles are no longer just rugged foresters but renowned timbermen and master shipbuilders. They take pride in their ability to craft ships that brave the harshest seas. Unlike the warlike reputation of orcs elsewhere, these orcs are known for their cooperation, craftsmanship, and innovation. Family and community remain central to their lives, with entire clans working together in shipyards, passing down skills through generations.


        The partnership with the gnomes has also deeply influenced orc culture. The orcs have adopted some of the gnomes’ intricate designs, and in return, the gnomes have learned to appreciate the orcs’ reverence for the land and their sustainable logging practices.

        The gnomes of Trotroles are the embodiment of curiosity and ingenuity, adapting to every twist in the world’s tumultuous history with boundless energy and creativity. Though small in stature, their contributions have left an outsized mark on Trotroles, from their steam-powered contraptions during the Great Sundering to their modern-day innovations blending magic and technology.


        ## History

        ### Before the Great Sundering

        Gnomes thrived as master artisans and arcane engineers. Working closely with elves, dragonborn, and other races, they developed magical infrastructure across Trotroles, from enchanted machinery to protective wards. Their natural affinity for problem-solving made them indispensable in maintaining the Elemental Gates, especially as they innovated ways to stabilize the raw elemental energy flowing through them.


        ### During the Great Sundering

        When magic disappeared, the gnomes were among the first to pivot. They became the pioneers of mechanical engineering, crafting steam-powered machinery, intricate clockworks, and ingenious systems that kept communities functioning in the absence of arcane power. This era marked a golden age for gnomish ingenuity, with entire settlements becoming hubs of invention.


        ### After Magic Returned

        The return of magic brought a new era of possibilities for the gnomes. They fused their mechanical mastery with the rekindled arcane forces, creating a unique blend of technology and magic. Gnome-crafted  magical constructs became increasingly common across Trotroles, cementing their reputation as visionary inventors.


        ## Culture and Values


        **Collaboration and Community**


        Gnome settlements thrive on collaboration, with every individual contributing their unique skills to the community. Their towns are buzzing with workshops, laboratories, and communal spaces where ideas flow freely.


        **Boundless Curiosity**


        Gnomes are driven by an insatiable desire to understand the world around them. This curiosity often leads them to explore dangerous ruins, tinker with unstable devices, or experiment with unknown magical forces.


        **Optimism and Humor**


        Even in the face of disaster, gnomes maintain a lighthearted attitude. Humor is deeply ingrained in their culture, and their quick wit often disarms tensions or lifts spirits during tough times.


        **Innovation as a Way of Life**


        Gnomes believe that every problem has a solution waiting to be discovered. This mindset has led to the creation of countless devices, from life-saving inventions to whimsical gadgets that serve little purpose beyond bringing joy.


        ## Settlements in Trotroles

        **Aurorengard**


        In partnership with the orcs, gnomes were instrumental in transforming Aurorengard into a hub of timber and shipbuilding. They designed steam-powered sawmills and intricate tools, revolutionizing the lumber industry in the harsh north.


        **Sunset Spire** 


        Gnomes in this metropolis lead workshops producing everything from magical trinkets to advanced clockwork mechanisms. They are highly sought after as inventors and architects.


        **Bramblehop Isle**


        A few gnomes joined the harengon settlers, using their skills to fortify the island and develop efficient farming and defensive systems.


        **Eldergrove**


        Even in the overgrown ruins, gnome explorers and tinkerers can be found, scavenging for ancient magical artifacts and forgotten technologies.


        ## Symbols of Gnomish Heritage

        * The Gear and Glowstone

        A common emblem, the gear symbolizes invention and progress, while the glowstone represents the light of discovery and inspiration.


        * The Tinker’s Hammer

        A mark of ingenuity, this tool is both a practical emblem and a cherished symbol of gnomish resilience and creativity.


        * Clockwork Contraptions

        Often worn as jewelry or tokens, these miniature devices are a testament to their craftsmanship and sense of wonder.

        ![](https://i.redd.it/pymbh6mibvv11.jpg)


        The Shade is the name given to the mysterious and tyrannical beholder who rules over Skullport, a hidden and lawless subterranean city beneath Sunset Spire. Many have claimed this title over the centuries, and like those before, the current Shade is a paranoid, calculating creature who rules with cruelty and cunning. It manipulates its minions through fear, greed, and charm, ensuring loyalty through promises of power or the threat of annihilation.


        The Shade commands T@[](mhrrehevkb), a shadowy network of thieves, killers, and monsters. Its followers include the most unsavory denizens of @[](izwulaovpv), along with creatures drawn by promises of wealth, sustenance, or dominion. Treachery is rife within the Veiled Hand, as the Shade’s minions constantly vie for its favor. Yet, such rewards are always short-lived—paranoia compels the Shade to distrust even its most loyal servants, often destroying those it suspects of betrayal.


        **The Hidden City**


        @[](kvpdfhcnkh), the Shade’s hidden kingdom, sprawls across a massive underground cavern. This ramshackle city is built along an underground river, with crooked buildings stacked haphazardly atop one another. The streets are patrolled by flameskulls, ghostly sentinels that enforce the Shade’s laws with fiery precision. At the city’s heart lies the Shade’s lair, an opulent fortress of stone and shadow where the beholder rules like a monarch.


        The only creature the Shade appears to care for, beyond itself, is a small black fish it calls Voidscale, kept in a crystalline tank in its throne room. Voidscale is tended by terrified minions, for the fish’s inevitable death causes chaos as servants scramble to replace it before the Shade notices. Fortunately, the beholder’s paranoia blinds it to details, allowing them to swap Voidscale with another fish undetected.


        **The Stone of Golorr and @[](uljkcoouda)**


        Years ago, the Shade’s spies stole the legendary Stone of Golorr, an artifact containing secrets that led to the discovery of a dwarven vault beneath Sunset Spire. The vault, brimming with gold, seemed within the Shade’s grasp until it was driven out by the vault’s guardian—a fearsome dragon. The artifact remained in the Shade’s possession until recently, when it was stolen from its lair.


        The Shade is convinced that @[](uljkcoouda), a rival criminal syndicate, orchestrated the theft. This belief has only deepened its paranoia, and it now views the Silver Chain as its greatest threat. The Shade has unleashed its agents to recover the Stone of Golorr at any cost, vowing to destroy anyone aligned with @[](uljkcoouda).


        **Unyielding Paranoia**


        The Shade’s reign is driven by its all-consuming paranoia. It sees enemies everywhere, and its inability to trust even its closest minions keeps the Veiled Hand in a constant state of fear and infighting. This paranoia, while destructive, has also preserved the Shade’s power, as few are brave enough to challenge it directly.


        **Game Statistics**


        The Shade is a beholder whose formidable powers are further enhanced by three magical rings, worn on separate eyestalks:


        * A ring of invisibility on its fear ray eyestalk.

        * A ring of mind shielding on its sleep ray eyestalk.

        * A ring of resistance (force) on its slowing ray eyestalk.


        The Shade’s prized fish, Voidscale, has the statistics of a quipper but lacks the Blood Frenzy trait.


        The Shade’s obsession with the Stone of Golorr and its enmity toward the Silver Chain are on the brink of plunging both Skullport and Sunset Spire into chaos. It is a dangerous foe whose power, paranoia, and greed make it a relentless adversary to any who oppose it.

        ***Special Equipment.*** the Shade wears a ring of invisibility, a ring of mind shielding, and a ring of resistance (force).


        ***Antimagic Cone.*** The shad's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the shade decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the shade's own eye rays.


        ## Actions

        **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage.


        **Eye Rays.** the shade shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:


        * **1. Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the shade for 1 hour, or until the shade harms the creature.


        * **2. Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


        * **3. Fear Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


        * **4. Slowing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


        * **5. Enervation Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


        * **6. Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the shade moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of Xanathar's next turn or until the shade is incapacitated.

        If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. the shade can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.


        * **7. Sleep Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.


        * **8. Petrification Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.


        * **9. Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

        If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.


        * **10. Death Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.


        ## Legendary Actions

        the shade can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. the shade regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.


        **Eye Ray.** the shade uses one random eye ray.


        ## Lair Actions

        When fighting inside its lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:


        * A 50-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.

        * Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder's choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

        * An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.


        The beholder can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.


        ## Regional Effects

        A region containing a beholder's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:


        * Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched when they aren't.


        * When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mile of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's person.


        If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

        Thorvin Twinbeard was the chief engineer of the Veil hand Thieves' Guild in the sunset spire.


        Thorvin was the chief engineer and trapsmith for the shade. He was also a paid informant of the Harpers and informed them of the shade's plots under the cover of his maintenance inspections in Skullport.


        he was working on a mechanical beholder while three duergar and one gazer protected him. In truth, the gazer was spying on Thorvin under orders of the shade, who suspected the dwarf.


        He lived inside the beholder's lair. His pet project was a pulverizer to destroy for good the petrified victims of his master but he used it as cover to gather information to sell to the Harpers.

          ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.


          ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:


          ***At will:*** dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery


          ***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.


          ## Actions

          **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.


          **Illusory Appearance.** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.


          The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.


          **Invisible Passage.** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

            ## Actions

            **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.


            **Illusory Appearance.** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.


            The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.


            **Invisible Passage.** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

          ***Inscrutable.*** The sphinx is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain the sphinx's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.


          ***Magic Weapons.*** The sphinx's weapon attacks are magical.


          ***Spellcasting.*** The sphinx is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The sphinx has the following cleric spells prepared:


          ***Cantrips*** (at will): sacred flame, spare the dying, thaumaturgy


          ***1st level*** (4 slots): command, detect evil and good, detect magic


          ***2nd level*** (3 slots): lesser restoration, zone of truth


          ***3rd level*** (3 slots): dispel magic, tongues


          ***4th level*** (3 slots): banishment, freedom of movement


          ***5th level*** (2 slots): flame strike, greater restoration


          ***6th level*** (1 slot): heroes' feast


          ## Actions

          **Multiattack.** The sphinx makes two claw attacks.


          **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.


          **Roar (3/Day).** The sphinx emits a magical roar. Each time it roars before finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.


          **First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


          **Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


          **Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.


          ## Legendary Actions

          The sphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sphinx regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.


          **Claw Attack.** The sphinx makes one claw attack.


          **Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** The sphinx magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.


          **Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** The sphinx casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.

          ### A Sphinx’s Lair

          A sphinx presides over an ancient temple, sepulcher, or vault, within which are hidden divine secrets and treasures beyond the reach of mortals.


          ## Lair Actions

          On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the sphinx can’t use an effect again until it finishes a short or long rest:


          * The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll initiative. The sphinx can choose not to reroll.


          * The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years older or younger (the sphinx’s choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A greater restoration spell can restore a creature’s age to normal.


          * The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything within moves up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx’s choice). Only the sphinx is immediately aware of the time change. A wish spell can return the caster and up to seven other creatures designated by the caster to their normal time.


          * The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see within in its lair to another plane of existence. Once outside its lair, the sphinx can’t use lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a bonus action on its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it.

          ***Description:***

          A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.

If it is hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displacer beast is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.

          A gazer is a tiny manifestation of a beholder's dreams.It resembles the beholder who dreamed it into existence, but its body is only 8 inches wide, and it has only four eyestalks. The beholder can see through the gazer's eyes and uses it to spy on enemies as well as it s other minions. A gazer can't speak any languages but can approximate mimicking words and sentences in a high-pitched, mocking manner. A lone gazer avoids picking fights with creatures that are Medium or larger, but a pack of them might take on larger prey. A gazer might follow humanoids in its territory, noisily mimicking their speech and generally being a nuisance, until they leave the area, but it flees if confronted by something it can't kill.

          *Tiny aberration, lawful evil*


          -----


          **Armor Class** 13


          **Hit Points** 36 (8d4 + 16)


          **Speed** 40 ft.


          ----


          **Skills** Stealth +5


          **Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons


          **Condition Immunities** blinded, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned


          **Senses** blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 12


          **Languages** understands Deep Speech but can’t speak, telepathy 60 ft.


          **Challenge** 3 (700 XP)


          -----


          ***Mindsense.*** The intellect devourer is aware of the presence of creatures within 300 feet of it that have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. It knows the relative distance and direction of each creature, regardless of physical barriers. Creatures under the effects of magic that protects the mind cannot be detected by the intellect devourer.


          ## Actions

          **Multiattack.** The intellect devourer makes one attack with its claws and uses Consume Mind.


          **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.


          **Consume Mind.** The intellect devourer chooses one creature it can see within 30 feet of it that has an Intelligence of 3 or higher. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take 16 (3d10) psychic damage. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Intelligence score is reduced to 0. The target is incapacitated until it regains at least 1 point of Intelligence (either from completing a long rest or from a lesser restoration spell).


          **Body Snatcher.** The intellect devourer chooses one incapacitated creature within 5 feet of it and engages it in a contest of Intelligence. The intellect devourer overpowers the creature’s mental defenses if it beats the target on a contested Intelligence check. The intellect devourer magically consumes the creature’s brain and teleports into its skull, taking full control of the target’s body. While inside the creature’s skull, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects outside of the host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its comprehension of language, its telepathy, and its traits. Otherwise, it inherits the target’s statistics, memories and knowledge, including spells and languages. If the host body drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer must leave the host. It can also be magically forced from the host’s body by means of a protection from evil and good spell being cast on the host. If the host’s devoured brain is restored (only possibly with a wish spell), the intellect devourer is forced out of the host. The intellect devourer can choose to leave the host at any time by spending 5 feet of its movement and then teleporting to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the target. Unless its brain is restored within 1 round, the body dies.

        blurb: >-
          # $[objectname]

          Scattered across Sunset Spire are eight massive stone guardians, ancient statues built to defend the city in times of dire need. These colossi are only activated in moments of great peril, such as an invading army or a seemingly insurmountable threat to the city’s survival. Due to their immense size and destructive power, the guardians are rarely called upon.


          Each of the statues has a unique name and appearance. The one known as the Blade Sentinel is too damaged to be reanimated, but the remaining seven can be brought to life by the wielder of the Amberstaff, a powerful relic that serves as the key to controlling them.


          Landmarks of the City

          Over centuries, the people of Sunset Spire have come to view the statues as permanent fixtures of the city, treating them more as landmarks than weapons of war. Buildings, marketplaces, and even homes have been constructed around and on top of some of the inanimate colossi. In their dormant state, the statues pose no danger; however, if one is ever activated, any structures built on or near it are inevitably destroyed as the guardian comes to life.


          Constructed Nature

          The stone guardians of Sunset Spire are marvels of ancient engineering and magic. In their animated state, they move with astonishing power and precision. As constructs, they have no need for air, food, water, or sleep. Their purpose is singular: to defend Sunset Spire, no matter the cost to its surroundings.


          Though dormant for generations, the people of Sunset Spire regard these guardians with awe and a measure of fear, for they embody both the city's strength and the devastation it is capable of unleashing in its defense.

          Fearsome green-skinned giants, trolls eat anything they can catch and devour. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll’s flesh.


          !!


          -------


          **Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)


          **Hit Points** 84 (8d10 + 40)


          **Speed** 30 ft.

          **Proficiency** Bonus +3

          _________


          *Keen Smell.* The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.


          *Regeneration.* The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.


          ## Actions


          **Multiattack.** The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.


          **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.


          **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage, and if the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

She became an active force for good in the city after assassins killed her husband. Arthagast Ulbrinter, and destroyed his remains . A high elf, she has two adult children (a half-elf son named Arthius, who is studying music in aurongard, and a half-elf daughter named Serenore, who lives on the islmoor island of Alaron with her husband and daughter). Lady Haventree retains a handful of loyal servants and spies. Remi holds secret Harper meetings in her villa, which is warded by all manner of spells. She uses a silver raven figurine of wondrous power to deliver messages to Harper spies scattered throughout the city.

        # $[objectname]


        Yalah Gralhund was a noble of House Gralhund in the sunset spire.


        **activities**


        Yalah used her time to monitor events in the city, kept a tight leash on her children, and uses her influence to collect secrets from the mouths of nobles, guildmasters, and commoners.


        **Personality**


        Yalah believed that it was only a matter of time before she could ascend among the Lords. From that position, she believed that she would guarantee the prosperity of the Gralhunds for future generations. Yalah had a keen mind and could easily identify friends and foes.


        **Relationships**


        Yalah knew her husband Orond adored her. She had the true loyalty of the bodyguard Hrabbaz. Yalah treated the Zhent master assassin @[](qjhbclfwlm) and all the Zhentarim as her underlings. She had befriended the rogue nimblewright.


        The choice of villain in the module determines Yalah Gralhund's motivations: if the villain was Jarlaxle, then she was a secret lover of the drow.

        *The characters are traveling by sea on a misty,

        starless night. The waters are becalmed,

        bringing their voyage to a near standstill.*


        * wat doen jullie

        * waarom zijn jullie op de boot



        ![](https://images.stockcake.com/public/b/2/8/b286ae34-9eac-4933-9d85-532b9b331ae0_medium/starry-night-sail-stockcake.jpg)


        ##

        ### GHOSTLIGHT’S INVITATION

        ##

        * A silent, black ship lunges out of the foggy

        darkness. Ghostly orbs of light .loat inside

        glass lanterns on its unmanned deck. Rows of

        oars run along the bottom of the ship,

        moving it swiftly in the becalmed waters.


        * The ship draws parallel to the characters’

        vessel. Ropes and grapples thrown by unseen

        hands clatter onto their deck and tow the

        ships to within 15 feet of each other.


        **DEVELOPMENT**


        * Characters who are sailors or proficient in **Intelligence (History)** know this vessel is

        none other than the legendary Ghostlight, a

        harbinger of good fortune or grave folly to

        those brave enough to board.


        * The PC with the highest passive **Wisdom

        (Insight)** senses the ship is inviting them

        aboard.


        * The PCs can cross the ropes to the Ghostlight

        with successful **DC 12** Dexterity checks


        ##

        **Hooks**


        * HOOK: APPEAL TO REWARD

        The stories about Ghostlight say the lost

        treasure horde of the pirate queen Golden

        Gillie is hidden on the ship, waiting for those

        brave enough to .ind it.


        * HOOK: APPEAL TO HEROISM

        It’s said Ghostlight appears to heroes when

        there is something wrong that needs to be

        righted in the afterlife. An invitation to board

        the ship is a chance to help the spirits of the

        dead sailors who call it their home.


        * HOOK: APPEAL TO DISCOVERY

        Legends say Ghostlight is home to the Fiddler’s

        Green, the afterlife for good sailors who did

        their duty well. The ship is also said to be the

        prison for the souls of evil sailors who deserve

        punishment. A dead friend or enemy might be

        found aboard, and this could be a rare chance

        to speak with that person one last time.


        ##

        **TRANSITION**


        If the characters board Ghostlight, go to

        @[](gsyeukkjmh). If they don’t, the ship returns

        another night and bids them board again, this

        time with the help of an illusory sailor who

        beckons to them pleadingly from the deck.

        ## Rats in the shadows

        * Ghostlight’s rigging and sails clank and clutter on the groaning, empty deck. **Ghostly orbs** of light float inside glass lanterns bolted to the masts and railings.


        * The wheel on the rear deck corrects itself

        without any hands to guide it.


        * The ship’s Figurehead is a smiling mermaid

        holding a scythe in one hand and an iron

        lantern in the other.


        * A door beneath the rear deck leads into the

        hold. It creaks open and closed in the wind.

        ----

        **DEVELOPMENT**


        * Three big @[](kgnrrpbpnv) lurk in the dark along

        the edges of the deck. PCs with a passive **Wisdom (Perception) of 14 or higher** notice

        them. The rats attack once noticed or when

        the PCs approach the door in the rear deck.


        * The orbs inside the lanterns are @[](xxjgpmtkee). Characters can shatter the glass on a

        successful attack with a bludgeoning

        weapon **(AC 12)**. The will-o’-

        wisps can’t attack or pass

        through the lanterns unless

        the glass breaks. If

        released, they use a Shock

        attack against the nearest

        target and flee.


        * If characters try to grab

        the **helm**, they must

        succeed at a **DC 20

        Strength** check to turn

        the wheel. Ghostlight’s

        lanterns .lare brightly as

        the ship tries to regain

        control each round with

        an opposed Strength

        check (+8).

        -----


        !!


        **Treasure**


        nside one of the glass lanterns on deck (see

        Appendix A: Maps), characters notice a blue tint

        to the light when they are within 10 feet. Inside

        the lantern is a blue gem that is actually an

        @[](dnuceghebs).


        !!


        --------

        **TRANSITION**


        When the characters go through door beneath

        the rear deck, they descend a 15-foot, winding

        staircase. Go to @[](etbttsnhdr).

        * A three-level ***tavern*** climbs up to the 30-

        foot high ceiling. Music and revelry

        fill the air, along with the smell of

        roasted meats and hearty ale.


        * Hundreds of green, ghostly sailors

        float around the room, guzzling

        ale and bellowing sea shanties.

        Alongside them, a few dozen living

        sailors cheer and lift their mugs.


        * The ***barkeeps*** slide free drinks to

        the living and dead patrons, as

        well as to the surprised new

        spirits who materialize on the

        barstools.


        -----

        ### DEVELOPMENT

        * The Wailing Banshee is a pocket

        dimension and tavern inside

        @[](hexyudqpkc). Living passengers

        stay here during their voyage, while the

        newly dead spend one last day reveling

        before being sent on to the afterlife.


        * The proprietor, @[](cmmmpilzhg), “closes the

        tab” at midnight on each new dead soul who

        appeared, sending them to either the

        Fiddler’s Green or the Galley of the Damned.


        * For events, rumors, and NPCs in The Wailing

        Banshee, see @[](fuiyjhlnca)


        * After a short time, @[](cmmmpilzhg) approaches the

        characters. Go to Darby’s Request.


        ---------


        ### DARBY’S REQUEST


        * Darby introduces himself as the proprietor.


        * He says he senses Ghostlight invited the

        characters aboard to help it solve a problem.


        * Darby says large, ghostly rats he's

        never seen before have been

        boiling up from depths of the

        ship. They’ve destroyed

        several innocent spirits.


        * Darby explains he hasn’t

        been able to send evil

        spirits to their afterlife in

        The Galley of the

        Damned for three days.

        He isn’t allowed to

        enter the Galley to

        investigate. He also

        hasn’t heard from the

        Galley’s keeper, Eskeril

        the Rat King.


        * Darby asks the PCs to

        go the Galley, .ind out

        what happened, and

        root out the rats.


        * He warns the characters that they must pass

        through the intoxicating Fiddler’s Green, the

        afterlife for good sailors, on the way to the

        Galley of the Damned. They must be careful

        not to fall prey to the Green's charms.


        -------


        ### TRANSITION


        If the characters agree to help Darby, he leads

        them behind the bar and lifts a trapdoor in the

        floor, revealing a staircase. It goes to Area 1 in @[](wbaapmwddm). Or go back to @[](gsyeukkjmh)

        ## AREA 1: THE ROLLING MEADOW

        * The stairs lead to a vast, sunny Field with

        knee-high grass. Merry Fiddle music and

        laughter carry on the cool breeze.


        * A giant willow tree stands at the center of

        the .ield about 200 feet from the entrance.


        * Groups of sailors cluster around the

        gleaming meadow, growing more dense

        closer to the tree. They sing, share bowls of

        ale, and lounge in the soft grass.



        ### DEVELOPMENT

        * The meadow is a circular pocket dimension.

        Walking directly away from the willow tree

        leads to its opposite side in an hour.

        * The sailors seem corporeal, but they’re

        neutral or good-aligned undead spirits.

        * The willow tree is the center of the

        dimension and has an open door in its trunk.

        None of the spirits here can pass through it.

        * Three events happen in order while the

        characters traverse the Fiddler’s Green.

        ## EVENT 1: THE FIDDLE

        * An overwhelmingly beautiful Fiddle song

        begins. PCs who hear it must pass a *DC 13

        Charisma saving throw* or be charmed by the

        next person they see for 1d4 hours.


        * Charmed PCs feel compelled to sing and

        dance with the person who charms them.

        Each time the PC moves within five feet of

        their charmer, they must pass a *DC 13

        Charisma save* or burst into a loud sea shanty

        while dancing with or around their charmer.

        While singing and dancing, they can't move

        more than five feet from their charmer and

        have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability

        checks. This effect lasts for three rounds.


        ## EVENT 2: THE DRINK

        * Sailors offer passing characters a bowl of

        cold, golden grog. The PCs must succeed on

        *DC 13 Wisdom saves* or find themselves

        drinking deeply from the bowl.

        * PCs who drink the grog must pass *DC 13

        Constitution saves* or be intoxicated for one

        hour, giving them disadvantage on attack

        rolls and Dexterity-based ability checks


        ## EVENT 3: THE RATS

        * Writhing, black shapes cut through the tall

        grass 20 feet away. Four giant, red-eyed rats

        leap out, tearing at the spirit of a sailor!


        ### COMBAT

        * The @[](kgnrrpbpnv) destroy the ghostly sailor

        in 1d4 rounds unless stopped. They target a

        new spirit if they destroy their current target.

        * The rats turn their attention toward anyone

        attacking them.


        ### TRANSITION

        The door in the willow tree leads through a

        curtain of its boughs along a wooden path. It

        ends in a stone arch. Passing through the arch

        leads to @[](fdibtvmuaw). If the characters return

        to Darby’s tavern, go to @[](etbttsnhdr).

          ## AREA 2: THE SEWERS

          * A short, damp tunnel opens up into a wide

          hall that smells of rot and sewage.

          * A river of murky filth pours from a sluice

          beneath the stone arch, forming a channel

          with stone walkways. The channel splits in

          opposite directions further down the tunnel.

          * Two large, grated pipes sit opposite each

          other a few feet along the walkway.

          * Iron lanterns with bobbing orbs

          of light illuminate the passages.


          ### DEVELOPMENT

          * PCs who step on the squares

          indicated on the map feel the

          floor click. They must succeed on *DC 15

          Dexterity saves* or be blasted by a wash of

          sewage exiting the pipes, taking **7 (2d6)

          bludgeoning** damage and falling prone.

          • The lanterns contain @[](xxjgpmtkee) and

          function as in @[](gsyeukkjmh).

          • A short way along the eastern tunnel, PCs can

          find an unlocked door leading to a small,

          musty room. Inside it are three burlap bags

          full of softly glowing, edible mushrooms


          !!


          ##### Treasure

          *A 50 gp sapphire is hidden beneath the

          mushroom bags.*


          !!


          !!


          *****Sidebar: Inside The Sewers*****

          * PCs submerged in sewage water for at least

          one round must pass *DC 11 Constitution

          saving throws* or contract @[](dwhhomcxnh).

          * PCs can cross the wooden planks with

          successful *DC 12 Dexterity checks*. Failure

          results in a fall into the sewage.

          * The tunnel ends in a short waterfall that

          leads down to a scum-.illed collection pool. A

          rickety plank crosses the .lowing water.


          ### DEVELOPMENT

          * Examining the 20-foot deep pool reveals

          glittering objects at the bottom, as well as a

          grate. Pulling the southernmost lantern

          opens the grate and drains all the water.


          !!


          **Treasure**

          *At the bottom of the pool

          are 30 gp, a silver pipe worth

          15 gp, and a Potion of Healing.*

          * An unlocked door opens into a partially

          collapsed room of worked stone. The .loor

          writhes and churns, coalescing into a swarm

          of tiny, chittering rats.


          **COMBAT**

          * The swarm of rats pours out of the entrance,

          attacking anyone in its path. The rats leap

          into the sewage and swim away as soon as

          they’re able, dispersing the swarm


          !!


          ***Treasure***


          *A PC who succeeds on a **DC 15 Wisdom

          (Perception) check** finds a gold anchor charm

          worth 30 gp among the room’s debris. The

          charm has the name “Mary” etched on it.*


          !!


          ### DEVELOPMENT

          * As the PCs exit or pass by Area 4, they hear

          the wet slap of feet fleeing to the west,

          followed by a squeaky voice that yells, “The

          Rat King will not be seeing visitors today!”

          * The voice is actually Mad Tilley (see Area 6)

          trying to draw the characters toward the

          worgs in Area 5.

          • PCs who pass a *DC 14 Wisdom (Insight)

          check* can tell the voice is a skillful imitation.


          ### TRANSITION

          If the group moves toward Areas 5, 6, or 7, go

          to Worg Guardians. The group can also

          backtrack to The @[](wbaapmwddm).

        ## AREA 5: COLLAPSED POOL

        * Collapsed walls have caused this chamber to

        flood with reeking sewage. Stacked rubble

        forms precarious walkways around the pond.

        * Two lupine, horse-sized beasts prowl in the

        muck, a low growl rumbling in their throats.


        ### DEVELOPMENT

        * Two ageless @[](blnnpiyzvt) named @[](cnlphllpie) and @[](wmpnrxdlyv)

        lurk at the edges of the pool. They guard the

        sewers from intruders but allow @[](skjyxucydv)

        to stay as long as she catches rats for them.

        * The worgs are aware of the PCs due to Mad

        Tilley's warning. They can be persuaded to

        let characters pass (see Worg Negotiation).

        * Both worgs haltingly speak Common.

        * The sewage is knee-deep. It's difficult terrain

        for creatures smaller than Large size.


        ### WORG NEGOTIATION

        *The worgs let the PCs pass if the conSlict score

        reaches 0. Go to Combat if it reaches 6*


        * The worgs begin with a conflict score of 3.

        * Giving each of them a rat to eat reduces their

        score by 1. PCs can capture a rat with a

        successful *DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check*.

        * A successful *DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation)

        check* reduces their score by 1.

        * They are skeptical of all other types of

        persuasion. Any other Charisma-based

        check increases their score by 1.

        * Using three syllable words (or longer)

        angers them and increases their score by 1.

        * Speaking to them in Goblin or Worg reduces

        their score by 1 (once only).

        * A successful *DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check*

        reveals one of the above details or their

        current conflict score.


        ##### COMBAT

        The worgs use their superior speed to race

        around, staying away from melee fighters.


        ### TRANSITION

        If the PCs get past the worgs, Mad Tilley (who

        has been watching from the hall using Invisible

        Passage) appears. She laughs maniacally and

        invites the characters to her “lair" to “discuss

        business matters.” If they agree, go to @[](pddrjnrbut). If they bypass her, go to @[](slkdbpomee). The

        group can also backtrack to @[](fdibtvmuaw).

        ## AREA 6: MAD TILLEY’S LAIR

        * A frothing cauldron hangs over an open .ire

        in the center of this smoky room.

        * Rat skins, bones, dented tin mugs, shattered

        oars, bottles, and other debris hang from the

        walls and cover driftwood shelves.

        * A hunched-over, green-skinned crone

        mutters to herself and casts a handful of

        powder into the cauldron, which flares

        purple and hisses. She beckons to you.


        ### DEVELOPMENT

        * Mad Tilley wants the

        characters’ help gathering

        the final ingredients for a

        spell (she’s reluctant to say

        the spell will free her from

        Ghostlight). She can’t enter the

        Fiddler’s Green and has been

        unable to find these items.

        * In exchange for the characters’

        help, @[](skjyxucydv) gives them

        information about Eskeril the

        @[](izxelfvicw) and the @[](pmqdmrewhl).

        • She asks the characters for four spell

        components: A dead eye, a divine breath, a

        stolen drink, and a last song. What these

        actually are and how to get them are up to

        the PCs to interpret.

        • If the characters get these components for

        Mad Tilley, she tells them the details in What

        Mad Tilley Knows before casting her spell

        and disappearing with a triumphant shriek.


        ### WHAT MAD TILLEY KNOWS

        * @[](izxelfvicw) is the immortal keeper

        of the @[](pmqdmrewhl). Ever a

        competitive fool, he allowed himself to be

        tricked by a spirit named @[](jcyutluvak).

        * Jarvey was a wily, heartless pirate in life who

        burned his enemies’ ships while playing jolly

        songs on his tin whistle.

        * Jarvey has corrupted Eskeril’s loyal

        rat minions with the help of the

        Eskeril’s magical, haunted pipes.

        Ever since then, the crazed rats

        have prevented any newly

        damned souls from entering

        the Galley.


        !!


        ##### Treasure

        *Hidden inside a foggy,

        green bottle on Mad

        Tilley’s shelves is the map

        leading to Captain Golden

        Gillie’s legendary treasure

        hoard.*


        !!


        ### TRANSITION

        If the characters go back

        toward the entrance of the

        sewers, go to @[](fdibtvmuaw). If they

        move toward Area 7, go to @[](slkdbpomee).

        ## AREA 7: RAFTS AND PLANKS

        * The entrance to a lightless tunnel sits across

        a churning pond of sewage.

        * Four grime-crusted pipes jut from the walls.

        * A network of lashed-together rafts and loose

        planks bob in the swill, offering a precarious

        path to the tunnel.


        ### DEVELOPMENT

        * An obsidian @[](kltsmsktrw) haunts the waters

        here, targeting creatures in the sewage. PCs

        can spot it with a successful *DC 15 Wisdom

        (Perception) check*.

        • Characters can leap between pieces of

        floating debris with successful *DC 15

        Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks*. On a failed

        check, PCs must succeed on *DC 13 Dexterity

        saves* or fall into the pond.

        • Once every 1d4 rounds, the pipes unleash a

        torrent of muck, causing the debris to bob

        and spin. Any PCs on the debris must succeed

        on *DC 13 Dexterity saves* or fall into the

        sewage.


        ### COMBAT

        * The @[](kltsmsktrw) uses its Tentacles on the

        nearest target swimming in the sewage. It

        doesn’t attack creatures balanced on the

        debris. The octopus drags grappled

        characters down into the 20-foot deep water

        (suffocating rules found here).

        • The octopus can’t always distinguish

        between creatures and objects. PCs can

        distract it from attacking for one round by

        throwing an item into the water and passing

        a *DC 13 Charisma (Performance) check*.


        ### TRANSITION

        The dark, long tunnel echoes with a distant

        drum beat. It leads to @[](pmqdmrewhl).

        ## AREA 8: THE INFINITE ROW

        * A steady beat echoes through the wide

        underbelly of Ghostlight. It’s the heartbeat of

        the ship itself, keeping time for the shackled,

        spectral sailors rowing oars.

        * The benches of mariners seems to stretch

        infinitely, like a mirror reelected upon itself.

        * At the distant end of the galley, a sailor with

        curly blonde hair and a childish grin reclines

        on a throne carved to look like a swarm of

        rats. He clutches a gleaming @[](tdcmsiyylv).

        * Four rats of churning smoke of leap from the

        gloom on either side of the entrance!


        ### DEVELOPMENT

        * @[](jcyutluvak) sits on Eskeril’s throne.

        When the PCs approach, he demands they

        halt or he'll have his rats eat them alive.

        • At the same time, @[](izxelfvicw)

        shouts triumphantly, calling for the PCs to

        defeat the knave on this throne. He’s chained

        in the rowing spot Jarvey once occupied.

        • The rows of sailors seem in.inite by illusion,

        but the hall is only 90 feet from end to end.

        The spirits can’t leave their shackles.


        ### COMBAT

        * Jarvey has Eskeril’s @[](tdcmsiyylv). He is

        corporeal (use @[](juusrytyrs) statistics), having

        wrested some magical power from Eskeril.

        * Jarvey begins with the four @[](kgnrrpbpnv) allies

        by the portal. Each round, the pipes cause

        one new shadow rat to appear under

        Jarvey’s command within 30 feet of him.

        * If the characters take the pipes from Jarvey,

        the shadow rats transform into @[](glrchpgava)

        and become hostile toward him.

        * The PCs can free Eskeril from his shackles

        with a successful *DC 20 Strength check* or a

        successful *DC 20 Dexterity* check with

        thieves’ tools. He merrily joins the fight.


        ### TRANSITION

        Once the confrontation is over, go to @[](ppkhzwmbdq).

        ### DEFEATING JARVEY

        * If the PCs defeat Jarvey and free Eskeril, the

        reinstated Rat King thanks them heartily. He

        says he fell prey to Jarvey’s cheating soul.

        * Eskeril explains that all sailors’ spirits have

        the right to challenge him to a duel of wits or

        performance to gain the freedom to roam the

        ship (although evil spirits can't enter the

        Fiddler’s Green). But Jarvey didn't play by the

        rules and stole Eskeril’s magic pipes, causing

        Eskeril’s rats to become corrupted and evil.

        * If the PCs return @[](tdcmsiyylv), he gives

        them a @[](tcfwdnsjxx) that looks like a rat’s eye. He

        says they can shatter it to call @[](hexyudqpkc) to

        them in a time of need, and he will help them.


        ### JARVEY WINS?

        * If Jarvey defeats the characters, rather than

        kill them, he imprisons them as rowers in the

        @[](pmqdmrewhl). They have the right to

        challenge him to a duel of wits or

        performance for their freedom, and it is a

        cosmic law Jarvey can’t deny.

        * The PCs may win their freedom to roam the

        ship this way, but they can't actually leave

        @[](hexyudqpkc) without additional intervention,

        such as help from @[](cmmmpilzhg) or @[](skjyxucydv).


        ### LEAVING GHOSTLIGHT

        * @[](cmmmpilzhg) is thrilled if the characters manage to

        restore order to the ship. If they want to

        speak to a dead soul aboard, he arranges a

        meeting at a back table in the tavern.

        And he gives them a @[](fctjouhali) with a wink he says colegas.

        * When the characters are ready to leave

        @[](hexyudqpkc), the ship pulls next to their

        original vessel and extends a rigging net to

        allow them to cross safely. The ship

        remembers their deeds aboard and may

        reward them if they ever find themselves

        once again in the halls of dead mariners.

          ## Jarlaxle Baenre


          J@[](pslbfaclmd) is a Sea elf swashbuckler and the secret lord of Luskan, the City of Sails.jarlaxle plans to usethe cache of dragons to buy his way into the Lords' Alliance, a confederation of cities and towns that band together against common threats.Jarlaxle also wants the dragonstaff of Ahghairon for leverage in his nego- tiations. In the magical guise of a human sea captain named Zardoz Zord,Jarlaxle runs a traveling carnival called the Sea Maidens Faire and lairs aboard a ship in Waterdeep's harbor that has a submarine (@[](qfynqwueks)) underneath it, as described in chapter 7. jarlaxle delights in thwarting his enemies, enjoys the complications that arise when adventurers try to meddle in his affairs, and loves to see the looks on their faces when he finally gets the better of them. He doesn't suffer fools who threaten him, however. If forced into a violent confrontation, he swiftly and brutally kills someone to make an example of them and then walks off. If you choose Jarlaxle as the villain, the adventure takes place in the autumn.

          ## SEASONS 

          The adventure unfolds in a particular season depending on the villain you choose at the outset. If you switch to a new villain midway through the adventure, don't change the season to match unless the characters take enough downtime for seasons to change naturally.


          !!


          ### Spring

          In @[](izwulaovpv), early spring tends to be cold and damp. Misty rain falls for days on end. It's common for fog to settle at night and last through the day. As the weather improves, the city attracts more visitors, and the streets become increasingly crowded as summer approaches. 


          !!


          !!


          ### SUMMER 

          Summers in @[](izwulaovpv) are quite comfortable, and it's a great time for citizens and visitors to congregate outside. The markets are busier than at any other time of year. Sometimes, though, warm air pushes up from the south and settles in the valleys north and east of the city. This air gets trapped, creating a hot spell that might last days or weeks. Activity in the city slows to a craw , since the people are unaccustomed to such beat. 


          !!


          !!


          ### AUTUMN 

          Throughout autumn, wagonloads of food arrive in @[](izwulaovpv) from outlying farms. Without this bounty, city folk would starve during the winter. Cold, howling sea winds remind the people that winter is near.


          !!


          !!

          ### WINTER 

          @[](izwulaovpv) winters are harsh. As snow piles up around the city and ice fills the harbor, trade grinds to a bait and the city seals its gates. Citizens willing to brave the cold still gather in local taverns and festhalls, but few venture outside the city walls.

          ## BREAKING THE LAW 

          @[](izwulaovpv) is a city of firm laws and swift justice. Adventurers hell-bent on slaughter and plunder won't fare well in the City of Splendors. The punishments for assault, arson, theft, and murder are severe, regardless of the reason for the crime. If the characters express interest in knowing more about crimes and punishments in @[](izwulaovpv), give them the Code Legal handout in appendix C. Characters who overtly engage in criminal behavior are quickly cornered and arrested by members of the City Watch. Those charged with committing a crime are brought before a magister to be judged. Advocates might intercede on behalf of the characters if they have allied themselves with influential NPCs and factions. For example, characters who become agents of the @[](yepvhtgcmx) are more likely to be excused for crimes if the @[](dyhxfrvpvw). has cause to let them off the hook. Given how strictly laws are enforced in @[](izwulaovpv), it's possible that the adventure could end with one or more of the characters being exiled, sentenced to several years of hard labor, imprisoned, or put to death. Tf that's how their adventure ends, so be it. Hopefully, your next group will fare better.


          ## ARRESTING CHARACTERS
           When the authorities show up to arrest one or more player characters for breaking the law, you can handle the arrest in one of two ways. The first approach is to roleplay the encounter with the arresting officers of the City Watch. The benefit of this approach is that characters can choose to go quietly or resist. The drawback is that the encounter might devolve into a fight-or-flight situation, leading to one or more characters becoming fugitives. If the party includes one or more characters who aren't lawful, such an outcome is likely. To mitigate this drawback, you might allow fugitive characters to forge alliances with NPCs who can help clear their names. If the threat of arrest becomes tedious, you can switch to the second approach, which is to merely inform the players that one or more characters have been arrested. You can describe the arrest , the subsequent detention, and the events leading up to the trial. The drawback to this approach is that player characters have no control over the situation. (This sense of helplessness has the virtue of being realistic, if not fun.) To mitigate this drawback, you might allow characters to make ability checks to influence the outcome; for example, a success-ful Charisma (Persuasion) check might enable a character to bribe an official or sow enough doubt in the mind of a magistrate to have the case thrown out.

        ### TAVERN BRAWL


        !!


        You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yell- ing and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard th re e tables over. Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya pig! Like killin ' me mates, does ya?" Then a seven-foot-tall halforc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump Into the fray. The half-ore cracks her knuckles, roa rs, and leaps at the tattooed figure- but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?


        !!


        The human combatants are

        five members of @[](mhrrehevkb) (CE huma bandit).

        The one with the eye- shaped tattoos on his bald pate is their leader, @[](ekcoxzwflg). Their foe, @[](bmfrvkirop), is a half-ore employed by the @[](uljkcoouda) (see the Yawning Portal Friendly Faces handout in appendix C). Yagra fights for her pride.

          ***GETTING INVOLVED***


          If the characters choose to join the fray, have everyone roll initiative. But the fight is almost over by the time they push through the rowdy spectators. @[](ekcoxzwflg) has only 3 hit points remaining and is trying to escape from underneath @[](bmfrvkirop), but the four other @[](mhrrehevkb) Guild  members are poised to tackle her. Pulling Yagra away from Krentz requires a successful Strength check contested by Yagra's Strength check. Yagra thanks the characters if they help her, but is disappointed that they interfered in the fight. Remember how the characters deal with Krentz in this scene. If he survives, the characters might meet him again in one of the @[](mhrrehevkb) sewer hideouts (see area QS, page 28).


          **HANGING BACK** 

          If the characters don't interfere in the brawl, Yagra knocks Krentz out cold but is then beaten unconscious by his companions. @[](rkcykwttry), the proprietor of the @[](uhegpakveg), points toward the door. "Out!" he snarls, and the @[](mhrrehevkb) members flee carrying Krentz's unconscious form.

          Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the tap· room-a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and blood· shot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, "Troll!"


          !!


          The @[](wqbglmgsyu), which currently has 44 hit points, has crawled up from the first level of Undermountain to feed on tasty humanoid flesh, bringing nine @[](ewrpcjekrp) with it. Once in the taproom, the troll rises to its full height of 9 feet and rolls initiative. The stirges also roll initiative, but only the three flying above the troll pose a threat. The remaining stirges are bloated, having drained copious amounts of the troll's blood, and fly back down the shaft to digest their meal. As the troll regenerates, the effects of its blood loss become less apparent. Most tavern patrons and staffers flee or take cover at the sight of the troll. The stirges attack the nearest characters as @[](rkcykwttry) (see appendix B) draws his greatsword, springs over the bar, and confronts the monster himself. As he attacks, he calls on the characters to focus on s laying the stirges and then douse the troll with lamp oil and set it on fire when it falls. @[](bmfrvkirop) joins the fight if she's conscious. To any characters who help defeat the troll, Durnan says matter-of-factly, "You fought well."

          If any of the characters are reduced to 0 hit points

          during the fight, employees of the Yawning Portal step

          forward to stabilize them.

          Once the troll and the stirges are dealt with, Volo pushes against the tide of patrons staying clear of the monster to greet the characters, lavishing praise on them for their bravery (whether justified or not): "You be adventurers, am I right? I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?" @[](egcbdttyqh) is known to most as a braggart and a notorious embellisher of facts. For all his faults, though, Volo is a soft-hearted so rt who cares for nothing as much as his friends. At present, he is grievously concerned for the well-being of one of them. He begins his request with an air of charm and mystery, but it quickly devolves into tearful sincerity.


          !!


          The figure who approached you strokes his mustache,

          adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. "Volothamp

          Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your

          service. I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city

          these past tendays. I haven 't seen so mutsh blood in a longe time. But now I fear I have missplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence.

          "My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more

          beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home

          a couple nights ago and was kidnapped-or worse. If you

          agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer

          you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten

          times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in

          my hour of need?"


          !!


          Volo gives each character a small pouch containing 10 gp simply for accepting his quest. Characters who want to discover his intentions must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, a character discerns that @[](egcbdttyqh) is honest but might be stretching the truth about how much he can pay. (Currently low on cash, Volo is awaiting royalty payments from Volo's Guide to Monsters. To make more coin. he began work on a new book, Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters. As it happens, his knowledge of spirits mostly concerns the alcoholic varirety, and the writing has not been going well.) If pressed, Volo urges the characters to trust him, and promises he'll have the rest of the reward, 100 gp per character, ready to deliver once @[](lcxvdhifro) is returned to him alive. Volo describ es Floon as a hand some human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was dressed in princely garb when Volo last saw him. Two nights ago, before Floon disappeared , he and Volo were drinking and merrymaking at @[](lnnuvfucgc), a dark, bawdy tavern in the @[](jyuflfgbbw). Volo recommends that the characters start their search there


          **WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?**


          @[](egcbdttyqh) is embarrassed to admit he might have gotten his friend Floon in trouble, and he resists providing all the details of what happened the night Floon disappear ed . Beset by writer's block, Volo met Floon Blagmaar for drinks at the @[](lnnuvfucgc) two nights ago. They drank and gambled for a few hours, and then Volo left. That's the l ast he saw of Floon. Unbeknownst to Volo, not long after he departed, a drunken Floon met another acquaintance, Lord @[](naeyrqcnld), at the tavern. The two left together, with Renaer offering to walk Floon home. Five @[](uljkcoouda) thugs working for Urstul Floxin (see appendixB) jumped both Floon and Renaer. They took them to a warehouse in the Dock Ward, so they could question Renaer- the son of Lord Dagult Neverember-a bout the whereabouts of the Stone of Golorr and his father's hidd en cache of dragons. Before the interrogation could begin, m embers of the @[](mhrrehevkb)ambushed and kill ed the Zhent guards in the warehouse. The new ar @[](uljkcoouda) mistook Floon for Renaer, knocked Floon unconsc ious, and dragged him away while Renaer hid and escaped their notice. Floon was taken to a @[](mhrrehevkb) hideout in the sewers . A small gang of @[](uupvqkuerv) was left behind at the @[](uljkcoouda) warehouse to kill any other @[](uljkcoouda) who might show up at the warehouse. The presence of the kenku h as prevented Renaer from trying to leave the warehouse.

            As the characters travel through the Dock Ward, they come upon the aftermath of a bloody clash between @[](mhrrehevkb) and @[](uljkcoouda):


            !!


            As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. "Get on," she says. "Nothing to see here."


            !!


            The skirmish that occurred here has nothing to do with Floons disappearance but represents an escalation in the conflict between @[](uljkcoouda) and the @[](mhrrehevkb). A dozen guards of the City Watch have arrested three bandits and are questioning witnesses while waiting for wagons to take away the criminals and the corpses. The survivors of the skirmish have been stripped of their weapons and forced to kneel with their hands on their heads. All three, loyal @[](uljkcoouda) agents. are likely to be accused of murder. They coldly catch the eye of anyone who passes by, but the City Watch won't let the characters anywhere near the prisoners .

            A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop 's door as you peer inside. Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet. The hairless old gnome sitting crosslegged on the counter wears plum-colored robes. His cheeks are decorated with nine purple face-painted eyes. The gnome lowers a pipe and exhales a cloud of lavenlender smoke before raising a hand. "Hail and well met! Come browse the shelves of the most curious curiosity shop in the world! "


            !!


            The shop is named after the stuffed beholder in the window-a figure that is actually a magical sensor, through which@[](xvzggvlclw) can peer whenever it wishes. The shopkeeper is a wizened deep gnome who spies for @[](mhrrehevkb). A few years ago, he survived the detonation of a gas spore in Undermountain and inherited some stray beholder memories. Driven by a compulsion to carve out his own domain, the gnome sett led in @[](izwulaovpv), bought the Old Xoblob Shop from its previous owner, and tried renaming it after himself, yet everyone kept calling it the Old Xoblob Shop. He therefore restored the old name and changed his name to Xoblob. ·'No relation to the eye tyrant hanging in the window!" he says. 


            **Trinkets.** The gnome sells an assortment of trinkets. As the characters search the shelves, roll on the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook to determine what catches their eye. Xoblob sells any trinket for ld6 gp. 


            **Floon's Fate.** The gnome doesn't know Floon by name, but he recognizes his description. He is reluctant to share information, but offering him a new purple item or succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check loosens his tongue. He says that Floon and a well-dressed fellow of similar appearance and bearing (Renaer Neverember, though the gnome doesn't know his name and didn't recognize him) were jumped outside the shop by rough-looking men in black leather armor. Xoblob thinks there were five attackers, but none of them looked familiar. One of them had a black tattoo of a winged snake on his neck.

            The Skewered Dragon looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship's anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards.


            !!


            Floon has not been at the Skewered Dragon since the night of his disappearance, and the dive's dockworker patrons are loath to talk to strangers. A bribe or a successful DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check gets them to open up.


            ***Floon's Fate.*** Several of the regulars remember seeing Volo and Floon drinking together a couple of nights ago. After Volo left, Floon stuck around long enough to meet with another friend: Renaer Neverember, the son of@[](izwulaovpv)'s previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember. *"Chip off the old block, that one!"* sneers one patron. *'Just another spoiled, rich noble who likes to rub our noses in it!"* says another. The two drank and played a few rounds of Three Dragon Ante before leaving around midnight. Five men followed them out, and no one in the tavern knows what happened after that. The men who left shortly after Floon and Renaer haven't returned to the tavern since, but they're known to frequent a warehouse on Candle Lane . "Look for the snake symbol on the door," says one of the tavern regulars.

            Gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeonand as odorous as one, too. Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed. The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle.


            !!


            The flickering comes from the one streetlamp still intact

            on Candle Lane, kept alight by a continual flame spell.

            A warehouse is directly across the street from the lamp,

            which illuminates a black winged snake (the symbol of

            @[](uljkcoouda)) painted above the door's handle. Characters who have ties to the @[](uljkcoouda) recognize the

            symbol, while others can recall its significance with a

            successful *DC 10 Intelligence check.*

          The hideout on Castle Lane (see map 1.1) is a ram- shackle two-story warehouse. The Black Network has other sanctuaries in run-down buildings like this one throughout sunset spire (meaning that the floor plan of this locale can be reused for other silver chains hideouts). The warehouse stands at the back of an outer yard behind a high fence. The gate on the fence isn't locked. The building's three points of entry-a front door, a large warehouse loading door, and a painted-over window- are locked. The front door has a sliding peephole that can be opened from the inside. Either of the doors or the window can be unlocked by a character who makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Knocking at the doors or the window alerts a group of kenku inside that someone is coming. The kenku scramble to hide behind toppled furniture, making a ruckus that any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher can hear. These kenku are all that remain of the veildhand Guild force that murdered almost everyone in the warehouse after the five silver chain thugs captured Renaer Neverember and Floon Blagmaar and brought them here. Floon was taken away, but Renaer succeeded in staying alive by hiding. Now, the young noble is trying to figure out how to slip past the kenku, who are lazily searching the warehouse for loot while waiting to see if any more silver chaind mercs show up.

            The Silver chain's main business is recruiting, training, and equipping sell swords . Crates packed with weapons, rations, boots, black uniforms, and other gear fill the warehouse. 


            When the characters try to enter, determine if the four kenku inside are aware of their presence before reading the boxed text.


            A character with thieves' tools can pick the lock on a door or the window with a successful ***DC 10 Dexterity check***. Characters who enter quietly can try to catch the kenku by surprise. If the characters knock before entering or announce their arrival in some other way, the kenku hide as described above.


            !!


            A character with thieves' tools can pick the lock on a door or the window with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Characters who enter quietly can try to catch the kenku by surprise. If the characters knock before entering or announce their arrival in some other way, the kenku hide as described above. Tables and chairs have been carelessly tossed across the floor. The corpses of a dozen men lie along the walls, their rapiers and daggers lying nearby. On the north side of the area, stairs rise to an open level above.


            !!


            **If the kenku aren't hidden, add:**


            !!


            Four short, avian creatures with long beaks and black feathers look over in surprise from where they stand in the middle of the warehouse. Each wears a hooded cloak and wields a shortsword.


            !!


            The corpses belong to five human silver chain sellswords (the same ones who kidnapped Floon and Renaer) and seven human veild hand Guild thugs, all of them clad in leather armor. Each silver chaind has a black tattoo of a winged snake on his neck or forearm, and one of the veild hand Guild members has a black tattoo on the palm of his right hand that looks like a circle with ten spokes radiating out from its circumference (the symbol of Xanathar). The kenku fight until two of them are incapacitated or killed, where upon the survivors try to nee. 

            A successful ***DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation)*** check forces captured kenku to divulge what they know.


            ### WHAT THE KENKU KNOW


            When kenku speak, they mimic sounds and voices they have heard before. Under interrogation, they repeat the following phrases:


            * In a deep voice with an orcish accent: "The shade sends its regards.,.


            * In a thin, nasally voice: "Tie up the pretty boy in the back room!" and "Follow the yellow signs in the sewers." (This remark refers to tunnels in the sewers that are marked with the veild hand symbol where they lead to the veild hand Guild hideout.)


            * In a scratchy voice: "No time to loot the place just get him to the boss."

            The door to this back room hangs loosely on broken hinges. The cramped chamber beyond smells strongly of sour fish and vinegar. It is fill ed with discarded ropes. canvas tarpaulins, and splintered wood from smashed barrels. Renaer Neverember (see appendix B) is hiding here, having slipped free of his rope bonds. The characters can hear his ragged breathing coming from under a tarpaulin at the north end of the room.


            ### ROLEPLAYING RENAER 

            Renaer is unarmed. Marred by grime and the lingering stench of rancid pickled herring, he speaks with grace and articulation, as befits his noble upbringing. His trust is easily gained but impossible to restore once broken.


            On the night of the abduction, Renaer was concerned that Floon was too intoxicated to find his way home by himself and offered to escort him. The two were jumped by five thugs as they left Fillet Lane and headed north on Zastrow Street. Renaer feels guilty that Floon was taken, since he believes (correctly) that they mistook Floon for him. If the characters ask Renaer to join their search for Floon, he agrees to do so, arming himself with a dagger and a rapier scavenged from the dead silver chains in the warehouse. If a character asks Renaer why the silver chains kidnapped him, he gives the following truthful reply:


            !!


            "The Silver Chains thinks that my father embezzled a large amount of gold while he was Open Lord, and that he hid the coins somewhere in the city. They think they can find it by using an artifact called the Stone of Colorr, which was in the hands of the veild hand Guild until recently. Apparently, someone stole it. The silver chains thought I knew something about all of this, but I don't. My father and I haven't spoken in years."

          Shortly after the characters find Renaer, a captain of the City Watch named Hyustus Staget (LG male human veteran) leads a dozen veterans to the warehouse. Having received a report of suspicious activity, they barge in and try to prevent anyone from leaving. Kenku that are still alive and present are taken into custody, and it doesn't take long for the City Watch to conclude that the dead men are members of the Silver Chain and the Veild Hand Guild, since violent encounters between the two factions are becoming ever more frequent. While his constables search the warehouse, Captain Staget questions the characters. 


          Captain Staget is an uptight man who helps keep the peace in the Dock Ward. Every shopkeeper, guild member, innkeeper and tavern keeper in the Dock Ward knows him, and most respect him regard less of their opinions of the City Watch in general. Staget doesn't believe in rumors or gossip, he doesn't drink, and he doesn't let anger get the better of him. His job is to curb the violence in the Dock Ward, but he has been dragging his heels. After all, he reasons, if the veild hand Guild and the silver chain want to destroy each other, why not let them? 


          Staget once had the warehouse under surveillance, but elected to pull the detail to bolster patrols throughout the Dock Ward-a decision he now regrets. That surveillance was part of an attempt to catch a known silver chain merc instigator named Urstul Floxin, a "big fish'' rumored to be responsible for much of the recent strife. Staget doesn't share this information with strangers. 


          Staget and Renaer recognize each other, though they aren't well acquainted. The involvement of a Neverember noble prompts the captain to be on his best behavior. He is prepared to overlook any crimes committed by the characters as long as Renaer is with them, but he gives them a folded sheet of parchment with the Code Legal written on it and encourages them to read it. (Give the players a copy of the Code Legal handout in appendix C, if you haven't done so already.) 


          If the characters ask for the Watch's help in locating Floon. Staget makes it clear that he won't send a force into the sewers in search of someone who might well be a silver chain or veild hand Guild spy. If they appear intent on involving themselves further in the conflict between the silver chain and the veild hand Guild. Staget imparts some free advice before letting them go:

          * "Best not to meddle in criminal matters. Leave this dirty business to the City Watch.

          * " "Not all City Watch officers are as nice as me." 

          * "Keep the blood off the streets, okay?" (This is a common saying among City Watch officials, who care more about what happens in the city above than what happens in the sewers below.)


          Characters who stir up trouble in the Dock Ward are likely to run into Captain Staget again. Though he is secretly pl eased to have adventurers doing some of his work for him, he can't let them overshadow his own efforts to keep the peace without risking a reprimand from his superiors.

          At this point, the characters likely know that Floon was kidnapped by veil hands Guild members who mistook him for Renaer Neverember, and that he was taken to a hideout in the sewers. If the characters didn't learn from the kenku where Floon was taken, asking questions of the locals can reveal that many people saw him being dragged off. 


          A successful ***DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check*** or ***5 gp in bribes*** allows the characters to trace the kidnappers' path through back alleys to a circular metal cover inset in the pavement. The cover is easily lifted, revealing a ladder down into the sewers.


          ## NAVIGATING THE SEWERS

          *The sewers have no natural light. Characters without darkvision need light sources to see.*


          !!


          Een stinkende stroom stroomt door deze riooltunnel, die in twee richtingen gaat. In de ene richting zie je een klein symbool op de muur getekend met geel krijt: een cirkel ter grootte van een handpalm met tien equidistante spaken die uitstralen vanaf de omtrek.


          !!


          The hideout of the Veiild Hand Guild operatives who snatched up Floon is deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers. At every location where characters must make a decision about which direction to go, a symbol scrawled in yellow chalk- a stylized representation of The Shade is marked next to the tunnel that leads in the right direction. The symbols are erased by members of @[](mhrrehevkb) Guild or the Dungsweepers' Guild every few days, but these markings have yet to be removed.


          ### GAZER GUARD

          Before arriving at @[](mhrrehevkb) Guild hideout, the characters have an encounter in the sewers:


          !!


          Na een uur de borden door de tunnels te hebben gevolgd, kom je bij een driewegkruising waar een ladder omhoog leidt naar een stenen schacht die is afgedekt door een cirkelvormige metalen afdekking. Een van de bekende krijtsymbolen staat op een muur in de buurt, en zwevend bij het symbool zweeft een bolvormig, grapefruitgroot wezen met een bolvormig centraal oog en vier stompe oogstengels. Het ontbloot zijn tanden naar je.


          !!


          A hostile @[](rgpbfunmzu)  that is in league with Grum'shar, the local veil hand Guild boss, guards this intersection. Once the characters defeat it, they can press on, following the corridor where the chalk symbol is located; they reach the hideout after following the corect tunnel for 5 minutes.


          **Ladder.** Characters who climb the ladder and push open the metal cover find themselves in the cellar of the Spouting Fish, a tavern in the Dock Ward

          The Veild Hand Guild has hideouts throughout the sunset spires sewers. The floor plan of this locale can be reused for other hideouts. The boss of this hideout is a half-ore named Grum's bar. When the characters arrive, Grum'shar is interrogating Floon Blagmaar in area Q7. His display of torture techniques is a ploy to impress his other guest: a mind flayer named Nihiloor. All the doors in the hideout are unlocked. Grum'shar assumes that only those who have guild business will be able to find their way here.

CENTRAL HUB\n\nThe characters approach this area from the east. slogging through 1-foot-deep water and sewage.\n\n!!\n\nDe hoofdriooltunnel breidt zich uit tot een cirkelvormig knooppunt met een paar pijlsleuven die in de buitenwanden zijn uitgehouwen, recht tegenover elkaar. Twee doorgangen lopen door naar het noorden en het zuiden. Een stenen deur is in de achterwand van een stenen richel aan de westkant geplaatst\n\n!!\n\nIf the characters talk loudly or otherwise make a lot of noise here, the goblin sentries in areas Q2a and Q2b awaken and shoot arrows at them through the arrow slits. The slits provide the goblins with three quarters cover.\n\n### SECRET DOOR\nA secret door in the wall of the tunnel that leads south can be found with a successful ***DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.***\n\n## Q2. WATCH POSTS\nTwo goblin s are stationed here, one in area Q2a and one in Q2b. Allies of the veild hand Guild, they came here from Undermountain. The goblins rely on dark vision to see and are supposed to be watching area Q1 but both have dozed off. Characters who succeed on a ***DC 9 Dexterity (Stealth) check*** can sneak past the sleeping goblins without waking them. \n\n**TREASURE** Each goblin carries ld6 cp in a small pouch.\n\n## Q3. MESSY ROOM\nRusty weapons and threadbare clothing Utter the floor of this area, which serves as a coat room and armory. It contains nothing of value.\n\n## Q,4. EMPTY SLEEPING AREA\nThis room contains six tattered, straw-stuffed mattresses and nothing of value. If the occupant or occupants of area Q5 have not been dealt with already, the characters hear the sounds of activity in that room through the thin wooden door that separates these two chambers.\n\n## Q5. SLEEPING AREA\nThis room contains six tattered, straw stuffed mattresses and a hostile member of the veild hand Guild, a duergar named @[](eyllkdfdgr).\n\nIf @[](ekcoxzwflg) (CE human bandit) escaped from the @[](uhegpakveg) after the tavern brawl that kicked off the adventure, he's here as well. When the characters arrive, Zemk is using pieces of furniture to barricade the door to area Q6. If @[](ekcoxzwflg) is here, he's trying to explain that Zemk's approach won't work, and is telling him to plug the gap at the bottom of the door with blankets. Neither of them notices intruders right away unless the interlopers make a lot of noise. \n\nOnce combat starts, Zemk fights to the death. How Krentz reacts to the adventurers depends on how they treated him earlier. If they helped him, he gives them a chance to leave in peace, but he fights alongside Zemk if they refuse to withdraw. If the duergar is killed, Krentz flees if he can or surrenders if he must. Neither Zemk nor Krentz carries any treasure. Both report to @[](qhaaqkkqdx) (see area Q7).\n\n## Q,6. LAVATORY\nThis room has a hole in the floor that opens into a cesspit. A @[](mcdkpmycju) has emerged from the pit and killed two goblins that were sent into the room to dispose of it. The goblins' bones float amid the ooze's gooey form, and their pitted weapons lie on the floor nearby. None of the gear is salvageable.\n\n## Q7. Boss FIGHT\n\n!!\n\nThreadbare curtains hang on the east wall of a long hall, in the middle of which a muscular halforc in dingy robes stands with his foot on the chest of a male human with wavy red-blond hair. \n\nFire burns around the orc's clenched fist, and his victim cries and squirms helplessly beneath him. Seated on a raised platform to the south is a nightmarish figure wearing black robes. It has large white eyes and rubbery purple skin, with four tentacles encircling its inhuman mouth. It cradles and gently caresses what looks like a disembodied brain with feet.\n\n!!\n\nThe tentacled creature is Nihiloor, a mindflayer that is caressing an intellect devourer. \n\nUpon seeing the adventurers, Nihiloor rises from the stone chair, sets its pet down, and glides across the room, intending to leave through the double door in the west wall. The mind flayer expects @[](qhaaqkkqdx) and the @[](htgttvsmbw) to cover its escape. Nihiloor carries a 3 inc diameter stone orb carved to resemble an eyeball, similar to what one might see al the end of a beholder's eyestalk. This stone eye is the key to activating the magic portal in area Ql 1. The mind flayer uses it to return to the shades lair (described in chapter 5). It uses dominate monster to control someone who gets in its way and turns any such individuals against their allies.\n\nThe half-ore is @[](qhaaqkkqdx), a low-end Veild hand Guild boss. As soon as his minions retrieved who they thought was Renaer Neverember. the half-orc begged Nihiloor let him witness the interrogation of the captive, not realizing until after he did so that he had mistaken the prisoner's identity. Grum'shar attacks the characters in the hope of salvaging his reputation. He is an apprentice wizard, with these changes: \n* Grum'shar is chaotic evil. \n* @[](naeyrqcnld)He has these racial traits: When reduced to 0 hit points. he drops to 1 hit point instead (but can't do this again until he finishes a long rest). He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. He speaks Common and Ore.\n\n**ROLEPLAYING FLOON**\n\n As a result of Grum'shar's torture. @[](lcxvdhifro) has 1 hit point left. If he is healed by the characters, he is eternally grateful and shows his affection by hugging them. He stays close to them, trusting in their ability to protect him. lf Renaer is with the party, he can shoulder the burden of protecting Floon. \n\n**TREASURE**\n\n In a satchel. Grum'shar carries his spellbook, which contains the following spells: burning hands. disguise self. false life, shield, unseen servant, and witch bolt. Tucked behind the stone chair is a small, unlocked wooden chest containing two potions of healing, 16 gp, 82 sp., and 250 cp.\n\n## Q8 . GETAWAY PASSAGE \nThis room looks empty, but a thorough search accompanied by a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a rough-hewn tunnel hidden beneath a loose flagstone. The low tunnel leads north to area Q9.\n\n## Q9. PRIVATE CELLAR\nAn innocent halfling family, the Peabodys, brews beerin this cellar, which lies beneath their home on Fishgut Alley in the Dock Ward. Their cellar contains brewing supplies and lots of worthless clutter. The halflings haven't noticed the secret tunnel that leads to the veild hand Guild hideout; it 's concealed beneath a large flagstone that requires a Strength score of10 or higher to be lifted. \n\n**DEVELOPMENT**\n\n If the characters ascend out of the cellar and enter the Peabodys' small house, the halflings are initially alarmed but can be easily calmed. Upon learning of the secret trapdoor, they vow to seal it up again but allow the characters to make use of it if the need arises.\n\n## Q10 .SLEEPING QUARTERS \nStraw pallets lie on the floor, and rusty manacles are bolted to the walls.\n\n## Q11. BACK DOOR \nThis hideout contains a secret route to the shade's lair.\n\n!!\n\nIn the middle of this otherwise empty room is a stone pillar carved with a small symbol: a perfect circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference. In the middle of this circle is a smaller circular indentation that bears a passing resemblance to a lidless eye.\n\n!!\n\nIf the stone eye in Nibiloor's possession is pressed into the circular indentation, an opaque black doorway magically opens in the south wall. The opening is 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide. Any creature that passes through it appears in area X22 of the shade's lair (see chapter 5). The door is a one-way portal, and it closes again 1 minute after the stone eye is removed from the pillar.\n \n**NOT-SO-SECRET DOOR** \n\nThe secret door is plainly visible to anyone who approaches it from the east.\n\n## Q12. HOSTEL CELLAR \nA narrow passage leads to the cellar of a halfling-owned hostel on Spices Street in the Dock Ward. Medium characters must squeeze to reach this area from the tunnel. The hostel is used as a base by the Shard Shunners. a gang of haIfling wererats. They are aware of the veild hand Guild hideout, and the two gangs are tenuous allies. Roscoe Underbough, a Shard Shunner in hybrid form , guards the cellar. He hides in the northwest storeroom, ready to jump out and scare away anyone who heads for the stairs. Not eager to commit murder, Roscoe allows retreating  characters to flee back to the sewers. He is a @[](hkjpauopvg) . with these changes: \n\n* Roscoe is Small and has 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points. \n* He has these racial traits: He can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. He has ad- vantage on saving throws again st being frightened. He speaks Common and Halfling, and he knows thieves' cant. \n\n**DEVELOPMENT**\n\n If the characters defeat Roscoe or s lip past him, they can make their way up into the hostel, which caters to a mostly halfling clientele. With none of the other Shard Shunners currently present. the characters are greeted warmly by staff and patrons, who point them in the direction of the nearest bathhouse.\n\n"

          Returning to the Yawning Portal with Floon Blagmaar in tow marks the end of this introductory quest. All that remains is for the characters to collect their reward.


          #### REWARDS 

          Volo is drinking alone in the Yawning Portal while anxiously awaiting news of Floon's fate. He springs up and runs to em brace the characters and his friend as soon as he sees them.


          ##### A GOOD DEED 

          If the characters reunite Volo with Floon. Volo gives them a rather sheepish look as he explains their reward:


          !!


          " I confess that I have but few coins to spare. But never let it be said that Volo reneges on a promise. Allow me to present something much more valuable ." He holds out a scroll tube. ''The deed to a remarkable property here in The Sunset spire! We'll need a magistrate to witness the transfer of ownership. I'll arrange a meeting with one after you've inspect ed the estate and deemed it satisfactory."


          !!


          The tube contains a deed to @[](kymcpjpdcg), a historic building in the @[](tgyegrtqab) that the characters can claim as a home base. The deed has been notarized and appears legitimate (because it is). Volo recently bought the property because it is rumored to be haunted, and he was hoping that investigating it might yield a chapter for his next book. Volos Guide to Spirits and Specters. lf the characters accept their reward, Volo sets up a meeting with a tiefting magistrate named Kylynne Silmerhelve. The brief session takes place at a courthouse in the Castle Ward at highsun. Magistrate Silmerhelve witnesses the transfer of the deed, rendering the new ownership official, with the impatience of one who has more important matters to attend to. She also collects an estate transfer tax of 25 gp, which is normally paid by the new owners. If the characters can't afford this fee or don't want to pay it and they have befriended Renaer Neverember, be makes sure that Volo has a pouch of coins to cover the expense.


          **FINE FRIENDS**

           Volo, Floon. and Renaer all express their gratitude through camaraderie. If the characters need to call upon their new friends for an occasional favor, any of them are happy to oblige. Floon has little to offer the characters, but friendship with Volo and Renaer has its perks. Volo knows the best places to eat and find merriment. He can also give characters a tour of the sunset spire lf the characters accept his offer, share the information in chapter 9, "Volo's Sunset spire Enchiridion," with the players. Although Renaer is estranged from his rich and powerful father, he still has friends in high places. including Harpers who can come to the characters' rescue if they need it. If the characters are looking for an audience with influential persons in Sunset spire, Renaer can setup meetings with Mirt, Rem Ilia Haventree (see appendix B for both), or just about any other sunset noble, if he thinks the characters will comport themselves well.

          **Quest Giver:** Maris Brightfathom, a sea elf historian studying the Sailor’s Beacon.


          **Summary:** The Sailor’s Beacon has started dimming during the nights, causing unrest among sailors. Maris believes it’s connected to an ancient enchantment tied to the mosaic, but she needs help investigating its source.


          **Objective:** Gather materials from the Frostbound Workshop and delve into the mosaic’s history at Emberwatch Tower.


          **Complication:** The dimming is caused by a group of cultists secretly siphoning its power for a dark ritual. The players must decide how to deal with them.


          **Reward:** A magical compass that always points to safety, and Maris offers her knowledge of the district’s hidden treasures.

        "It's not the fall that kills you it's the thing that pushes you when you're not paying attention."


        !!


        A makeshift highway across the city's rooftops used by thieves and vagabonds, in many cases at their peril. 



        ##### A high-Altitude Highway

        A makeshift course of rope swings, plank bridges and carefully selected rooftops that allows a nimble body to make a swift progress across the city, the harpy's passage is known to most thieves, burglars and second-story operators in the city, though most avoid it.

        It can be used to get from one end of the city to the other in a fraction of the time, if you're willing to take the risk. Succesful travel along the route is at twice the speed of running trough the crowds and twisted streets of the @[](izwulaovpv). each character running the passage must succeed on a *DC 16 Dexterity (acrobatics)chek* to run the passage for every 100ft. of travel. An unsuccessful roll sees the character fumble and slow their pace, moving slower than moving on foot. if they fail the roll by more than 5 then the character falls, with the height they fall from being dependent on DM descresion (1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10ft falle)


        ##### The invisible stalker


        Using the Harpy's Passage is always a risk. Savvy runners always travel with a partner on the passage, and conventional wisdom among those in the know is to get back down to ground level as soon as you can. people fall from the Harpy's passage on their own, but that doesn't explain the long, bloody wounds carved into some of the bodies that have fallen. waiting at the highest point in the city, watching for signs of movement an **@[](vylmekndge)** floats at the ready should any dare to tread its path. It only knows it must kill anyone running the passage, and it  pursues its prey with abandon. if you elect to place the invisible stalker in play, roll *1D6* to determine how many turns your players have before they're spotted by the stalker, which will persue them aggressively and use its actions to shove them off course in a contested grapple check.

        ## Background

        The adventurers are summoned by @[](nvrgvkekqk), the formidable leader of the Iron Vows. She is terse and to the point: a dangerous creature—described as a large black panther-like beast with tentacles—escaped captivity and has been stalking the Dockwards and western districts of the Sunset Spire. Several residents have gone missing, and the creature must be dealt with quickly. Alive is preferred for the reward, but dead is acceptable if the threat becomes unmanageable.


        The Dockwards, already suffering from an economic downturn, are filled with abandoned properties, making it the perfect hiding spot for the @[](mlhxxbqruj). This mission isn't just about eliminating a threat; it’s about protecting the fragile peace of the wards.


        ## Quest Objectives

        * 1. Investigate the Dockwards. (how many lives has the beast taken)

        * 2.Track the beast

        * 3. resolve the treat. (bring evide



        ## Key NPCs

        * Alara Kade: The stern leader of the Iron Vows. She offers a reward of 250 gp for the live capture or 150 gp if the creature is killed.


        * Dockworker Witness: A nervous man who claims to have seen the beast prowling near a warehouse.


        * Local Healer: Treating a survivor who narrowly escaped, she describes wounds consistent with tentacles.


        !!


        The survivor lies trembling on a cot, deep gouges crisscrossing their arm and shoulder. "It wrapped around me," they whisper, "like living shadow... then vanished."


        !!



        * Rendar Vasq: The wealthy merchant whose menagerie originally housed the creature. He provides insights into its behavior and mentions the existence of a baby displacer beast, which he believes may still be loose.


        !!


        A portly man with a thin mustache and a finely embroidered coat, he exudes a mix of wealth and nervous energy. “This creature is a marvel of nature—and now a bane to my reputation!”


        !!


        ## Clues & Exploration

        1. Scene of Disappearances


        The adventurers can inspect the locations where people went missing.


        *    Survival (DC 13): Discover faint tracks leading toward abandoned warehouses.

        *    Perception (DC 15): Spot faint claw marks on doors or walls, evidence of the beast climbing.


        2. The Witness


        A shaken dockworker describes a "shadow with glowing eyes" that dragged his coworker into an alley.


        !!


        The wiry man’s hands shake as he recounts his story, his eyes darting nervously to every shadow. “It was big—too big, with glowing eyes—and it didn’t make a sound as it dragged my mate off.”


        !!


        *    He points them toward a cluster of derelict buildings near the docks.


        3. Abandoned Warehouse


        The creature has made its temporary lair here. Signs of its presence include shredded crates, bones of animals it has hunted, and faint traces of its bioluminescent eyeshine.


        ## The Displacer Beast Encounter


        **Tactical Setup**

        * Location: A dark, multi-level warehouse with high rafters, stacked crates, and plenty of shadows for the creature to exploit.


        !!


        The air is thick with dust and the scent of rot, and faint claw marks score the wooden floor. Shadows pool in the corners, broken only by thin beams of moonlight streaming through cracked boards.


        !!


        * Creature Stats: Displacer Beast (MM, CR 3).


        !!


        A sleek black feline form with six legs and two sinuous tentacles swaying from its back, its fur shimmers unnaturally. Its piercing yellow eyes lock onto you, and its image seems to blur and ripple unnervingly.


        !!


        * Behavior: The beast uses its natural stealth and Displacement to stay elusive, stalking the party from the shadows before striking.


        **Complications**

        * Environmental Hazards: Crates can fall, floors might creak, and rickety ladders could collapse if not handled carefully.

        * The Baby Displacer Beast: The baby is hiding in the rafters, frightened and aggressive if approached. If harmed, the mother becomes enraged, fighting to the death.


        !!


        Small but vicious, the cub yowls from its perch in the rafters, its tentacles flailing wildly. Though less coordinated than its mother, its sharp teeth and claws are still deadly.


        !!


        **Adjustments for Balance**


        If the fight becomes too overwhelming, the beast might retreat deeper into the city, setting up a follow-up encounter. Alternatively, reinforcements from the Iron Vows could arrive to assist the adventurers.


        ## Resolution


        * **Captured Alive:** The adventurers subdue the creature and deliver it to the Iron Vows. @[](nvrgvkekqk) pays a bonus for the creature's safe return.


        * **Creature Killed:** The Iron Vows lament the loss of a potential asset, but they prioritize the safety of the city.


        * **Baby Beast Discovered:** If the party captures or saves the baby, they can negotiate additional rewards or decide what to do with it themselves.


        ## Rewards


        * Gold: 250 gp for live capture, 150 gp for killing it.

        * Items: A small cache of goods from Rendar Vasq’s collection, including a Potion of Animal Friendship and an Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location.

        * Reputation: Completing the mission bolsters the party’s reputation with the Iron Vows and the people of Sunset Spire.


        ## Follow-Up Hook


        If the baby displacer beast is left alive, rumors may spread about a new menace lurking in the wilderness—or perhaps someone tries to tame it, setting up a future adventure.

        *Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*

        ![](https://explorednd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ioun-Stone-5e-Guide.png)


        An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.


        When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.


        A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.


        !!


        **Awareness.** You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.


        Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

        * The creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.


        **Infection**

        * It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.


        * At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

          Description of a Small Sea Elf Boat: The Aqua Whisper

          The Aqua Whisper is a beautifully crafted small boat designed specifically for the sea elves' needs. Measuring about 20 feet in length, it features a sleek, elongated hull that glides effortlessly through the water. The boat is constructed from a blend of light but durable woods, such as driftwood and softwood, treated with natural oils to enhance its resilience against the saltwater.


          **Design Features:**


          * Hull: The Aqua Whisper has a graceful, curved hull that mimics the flowing lines of ocean waves. Its shimmering blue-green finish reflects the colors of the sea, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its environment.


          * Sails: The boat is equipped with a single, triangular sail made from finely woven sea grass and dyed in deep ocean hues. The sail features intricate patterns inspired by the spirals of the tides and the forms of sea creatures, paying homage to the sea elves’ heritage.


          * Oars: For calm days when the wind is still, the Aqua Whisper is outfitted with a pair of elegantly carved oars. Each oar is adorned with marine motifs, including shells and fish, representing the bond between the sea elves and the ocean’s bounty.


          * Interior: The interior is spacious enough for a small crew, typically designed for three to four sea elves. It features woven mats made from soft seaweed, providing comfort during long fishing trips. There is also a small storage compartment at the stern for carrying supplies or catches from their fishing expeditions.


          * Cultural Elements: At the bow, a small figurehead carved in the likeness of a moonfish is a common sight, believed to bring good fortune and guidance to the crew. The figurehead glistens with shells and small pieces of sea glass, catching the light as the boat sails.


          The Aqua Whisper embodies the sea elves' values of harmony with nature, craftsmanship, and the spirit of adventure, making it a cherished vessel in their maritime culture.

          *Staff, legendary (requires attunement by the Blackstaff heir, who must be a wizard)*


          The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the @[](acksmetjoq), the highest ranking wizard in the @[](izwulaovpv). As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see "Personality" below).


          * **Animate Walking Statues.** You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of the @[](izwulaovpv). You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see "Personality" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.


          * **Dispel Magic.** You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.


          * **Drain Magic.** This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.


          * **Master of Enchantment.** When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.


          * **Sentience.** The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.


          * **Personality.** The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Sunset spire and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.


          In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to the @[](izwulaovpv) is beyond reproach.


          * **Spirit Trap.** When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)


          Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.

          Midwinter (also known as Deadwinter Day) was a festival to mark the midpoint of winter. It occurred on a special day between Hammer 30 and Alturiak 1. Amongst nobles and monarchs it was known as Midwinter and was traditionally used to make or renew alliances, although the common people called it Deadwinter Day, a reference to the cold and hard times that remained before the spring.

          The Grand Revel was a holiday celebrated in @[](izwulaovpv) on Alturiak 14. It consisted of numerous music and dance events, as well as the partaking of different kinds of sweet treats and traditional romantic getaways and exchanging of gifts by young couples.


          **Activities**


          The holiday was organized by clerics of ********, ******, ******. During the day, activities included large dancing rings on the streets for all ages, as well as dancing performances. After dusk, the holiday was celebrated with performances by bards and minstrels for families, in events known as "love feasts".


          Throughout the holiday, traditional sweet treats of all kinds


          It was also common for couples to slip away during the evening to kiss and exchange love promises and gifts. The most common tokens that were given this way were rings blessed by the clerics with faithfulness prayers.

          Due to the increased proximity between the Feywild and the Prime Material Plane, the influence each realm had over the other was considered to be at its height. While rural areas regarded the date with trepidation and practiced many superstitions (avoiding the forests, leaving confectionery treats on their porches, and the like), in Waterdeep it was a day of celebration.


          **Activities**

          The nobles hosted lavish masquerades, while the lower classes attired themselves in homemade disguises and went around soliciting temporary access into the celebrations in exchange for entertaining the crowds. Costumes included those of fey. The joyous festival tended to be seen with scorn by some inhabitants who considered the practice foolish and preferred to stay at home during the event.

          Fleetswake was a festival held in @[](izwulaovpv) during the last tenday of Ches. It celebrated the sea and deities associated with it, as well as maritime activities.


          **Activities**

          * The Shipwrights' Ball at the Shipwrights' House, located at the corner of Asteril's Way and Dock Street in the Dock Ward

          * Galas at the Copper Cup festhall, located in Smuggler's Run close to the South Gate.

          * The Fair Seas Festival, held on the last two days of Fleetswake and characterized by the consumption of large quantities of seafood and the contribution of donations to @[](aubttihbuv).


          During the entire event, ships were not charged the typical docking fees of the city, but their captains were expected to contribute with donations of at least 1 gp per day they remained docked.


          All donations collected in the festival were then consigned to @[](aubttihbuv)'s Cache, a sunken treasure located in the deepest part of Deepwater Harbor that was fiercely protected by merfolk and surrounded by myths and legends.

          The festival started with the meeting of the various Guilds of @[](izwulaovpv) in their respective halls for the announcement of new policies and a commemoration of their activities in the previous year. Following those meetings, the guilds sponsored a gala festival and dance that lasted from dusk to dawn. The dance was traditionally held in the Cynosure, the Field of Triumph, and the Market, typically also dominating all the streets and locations in the area between them.

          The festival celebrated honest merchants. As part of the day's activities, members of the several guilds of @[](izwulaovpv) renewed their memberships and paid their annual dues. Additionally, the guildmasters met the Lords of the @[](izwulaovpv) to keep them apprised of their charters for the coming year.


          During the 14th century DR, criminals charged with commercial crimes such as robbery and theft were subjected to public ridicule by being brought in front of the Palace of @[](izwulaovpv), where guild members threw nibs at them. The copper collected in this way was donated to the city.

Home and shop owners were expected to give the children treats such as candy, fruit, sweet rolls, sticks of salted meat, or small items \"to keep the trolls away from my door\". If the trolls were not appeased, it was likely that they would be the target of a prank at sundown, such as \"troll scratchings\" on doors or windows, raw eggs thrown at signs, windows, or those that were miserly to them earlier, and being serenaded by caterwauling during moondark.

          Shieldmeet was the equivalent of a leap year day, occurring once every four years.

          Nobles usually held court to hear the petitions of their people and to make or renew trade pacts, alliances, and agreements.

          Traditionally the day was used for fairs, bazaars, musical and theatrical performance.

          The festival consisted primarily of dances and balls, which were held throughout a city. In @[](izwulaovpv), the high-point of these nightly balls was the "Cynosure Ball"—this was jointly sponsored by the Church of Lliira's clergy, the local nobility, and the Lords of @[](izwulaovpv). Outside of formal balls, carefree dancing and various other pursuits that fell within the Lady of Joy's purview were prevalent in festhalls all throughout.


          During this holiday, many were known to dye their clothes or armor in colors of blue, antique gold, and coppery-orange. Many were also known to wear ceremonial, star-shaped masks. Cuisine commonly associated with the festival included barbecued meats as well as juices and alcoholic beverages of a pink color.

          It was traditionally a feast to celebrate the harvest and the abundance of food, but also the time when those wishing to travel left on their journeys before winter set in.


          This day was often an important anniversary to various governments. Often, taxes and tithes came due, rulers held "open courts" to hear the concerns of their citizens, oaths were publicly renewed, troops received marching orders to new duty stations, and guilds met to confer on prices and rate changes for goods and services.

          People who begun working on new projects during Stoneshar believed that their work would be blessed during the following year. On the other hand, the common wisdom stated that anyone who remained idle during the holiday were setting themselves up for misfortune and bad luck.

          During the day, a common custom involved people wearing their favored deities' holy symbols and exposing their private shrines, as well as businesses displaying them in the windows. Customers who worshiped matching deities with their merchants enjoyed discounted prices on products and services, and the difference was donated to temples or to the city itself.


          During the entire day, in memory of the wild magic that accompanied the Time of Troubles, the use of magic of any sort within the confines of the city was limited to self-defense and cases of extreme need only.

          The celebrations began in the evening when people placed candles into gutted pumpkins or gourds that had faces carved into them. Each pumpkin represented a person who had donned a mask, while the candle light represented who they truly were. For as long as the candle was lit, lies told and embarrassing acts wouldn't harm a person's reputation. As such, celebrations often devolved into chaotic anarchy. Bad luck came to those who returned after celebrating to find their pumpkin's candle had gone out. Intentionally blowing out someone else's candle or smashing their pumpkin risked drawing the ire of the gods.


          Tricks, pranks, and even pickpocketing were common on this night; thus tradition had people filling their pockets with candy in lieu of money. Pickpockets took the candy and replaced it with a small token such as a folded scrap of paper, or a trinket. More commonly, people just traded candy at face value, and readily handed it out to children who asked.

          The day traditionally marked the onset of winter. It was also a time to celebrate and honor the ancestors and the respected dead. On this day, folk blessed their ancestors' graves and performed the Ritual of Remembrance.[1][2] People also gathered to tell stories of the deeds of their ancestors and of the gods until deep into the night, until they merged and became legend. This was a time to hear of past heroes, great treasures, and lost cities.

          Simril was chiefly celebrated after dark, when the stars were visible across the sky. Celebrants located stars associated with their own births, or with their ancestors. Those without a lucky star could purchase star maps from merchants to help divine which belonged to them, based on when and where they were born. Cloudy weather was considered especially favorable on Simril, as finding one's star on an overcast sky was viewed as a blessing.


          Simril was celebrated outside, with people trying to stay awake the entire night gathered around bonfires with plenty of music, food, and warm drinks.

        If this pamphlet has found its way into your capable hands in anticipation of your visit, likely thanks to the efforts of a thoughtful friend or kin, allow me to explain the circumstances of entry to this resplendent city.


        You will have journeyed through lands under the protection and governance of the Lords of Sunset Spire long before you see its golden walls glinting in the sun. If you’ve traveled from the south via the @[](luyyroqgte), you will have met the City Guard stationed there. Should your path bring you from the Nord by way of the Long Road, the town of @[](eelbfhylec) will have marked your transition into the city’s influence. Regardless of your route, your approach will also likely have been noted by the vigilant Griffon Riders of the Sunset Watch, though their soaring sentinels are not always easy to spot.


        Fear not, for Sunset Spire is a welcoming city. You have nothing to fear from its guardians unless you arrive leading an army of orcs, a horde of gnolls, or similarly unpleasant company. Entry into Sunset Spire requires no toll (and beware any City Guard demanding one). Should this happen, you are encouraged to report the incident to a magister as soon as possible.


        If you arrive with a large caravan or aboard a ship, you will need to register with a @[](gjvuglnvaa) upon entering the city. Magisters are easily recognized by their dusky crimson robes and the squad of City Guard that always accompanies them. These officials, known colloquially as "red robes," are empowered to pass sentences without trial. It is wise to treat them with utmost respect.


        Travelers arriving alone or in small parties are not required to register unless their stay exceeds a tenday. Should this occur, you must register with a magister at a city gate, the harbor, or the central court. Failure to register upon exceeding the allotted time may result in fines or labor sentences. Registration subjects visitors to monthly taxation, but as a pragmatic farmer from Aurathal Fields once told me, "Better to give the city its due than let your coin vanish in penalties."



        ### EXCEPTIONS AND STRATEGIES


        For those unwilling to pay city taxes, accommodations can be sought outside the formal wards of the city. Options include the prosperous @[](unvnwjjgak) or the lively yet less regulated @[](ufqxcgmecw). Keep in mind, however, that while these areas offer respite from taxation, they do not fall under the protection of Sunset Spire’s Watch or the orderliness of Guild Law. Travelers choosing these alternatives are advised to remain vigilant.


        Arrivals during winter or at night require special procedures. Sunset Spire’s gates are closed after dusk, and ships arriving after dark or during the frosty season will be met by the City Guard and held until a magister can oversee their entry. Travelers should expect delays and prepare accordingly.


        The @[](qcmrhzpecp), a smaller and less frequented entry point leading to the @[](hazrsmsfsb), operates under different regulations. Used primarily by locals engaged in clam digging, net fishing, or small-scale trade, this gate does not welcome new arrivals to the city. Travelers approaching via the North Gate will be turned away unless they hold special permissions.


        ### AIRBORNE ARRIVALS


        If you approach by air, expect a swift and stern confrontation with @[](tjgyldglaq). Only those with a valid license are permitted to enter or overfly Sunset Spire’s airspace. It is highly recommended to land outside the city and make the final leg of your journey on foot or by carriage.


        ### YOUR ARRIVAL IN THE CITY


        The splendors of @[](izwulaovpv) are as vast as its high golden towers and as vibrant as its bustling streets. Each ward of the city offers unique sights, experiences, and opportunities for intrigue or adventure. This guide will prepare you for what lies ahead.


        Before you immerse yourself in the marvels of Sunset Spire, it is vital to acquaint yourself with the city’s rich history and traditions, as well as the expectations of decorum within @[](klgsnmpeuf)' most illustrious metropolis. Prepare yourself, traveler—your journey has only just begun!

        *"There shall come a time when our city and its deepwater

        bay shall grow in fame and fortune across many realms

        and marry worlds. Folk shall know of The Sunset Spire, our City

        of Splendors, and sing its praises. I have seen it thus, and I

        endeavor to make it true."*


        -Ahghairon, the first Open Lord of The Sunset Spire


        The plateau upon which Sunset Spire now stands has been home to countless peoples since time immemorial. The cycles of civilization at the foot of Mount Celestara have waxed and waned with the tides of history, bearing witness to both the glory and the ruin of ages.


        Long before the written records of humans, elf scholars tell us that the plateau was home to Aelinthaldaar, a radiant city that served as the capital of the elven empire of Illefarn. Here, amid towering spires and glades of shimmering light, the elves thrived. But change came with the arrival of the dwarf prospector Melair, who discovered veins of mithral beneath @[](vfkmmbarfa).


        With the blessing of the Illefarni, Melair summoned his kin, and together they carved out a vast subterranean realm. Thus, Clan Melairkyn came to rule the underworld, while the elves ruled the surface. Yet, this alliance was short-lived. When the Coronal of Illefarn—the elven emperor—ordered the Great Retreat to the Feywild, many elves obeyed. However, those who chose to remain resisted the command, leading to a tragic schism. The Coronal unleashed devastating magic, reducing Aelinthaldaar to rubble and scattering the elves who refused the retreat.


        The Melairkyn, betrayed by the loss of their surface allies, turned their backs on the elves forever, retreating deep into the earth. Legends say they continued their delves for centuries, disappearing into myth until they reemerged during The Great Sundering.


        ### A New Dawn: The Rise of Sunset Spire


        When humans, halflings, and thievlings,... arrived at the Deepwater Harbor, they found the ruins of Aelinthaldaar and the dwarven tunnels long abandoned. For over a thousand years, these settlers built and traded at the site, but their names and deeds are lost to history.


        One figure stands out: the wizard @[](xpdsyffddr), who built his tower at the base of @[](vfkmmbarfa) and ruled the lands around it until he, too, vanished into the mountain’s depths. Afterward, warlords rose to claim the harbor and the plateau as their own.


        Among them, @[](vomvetynnm) left the greatest mark. Known as the Warlord of the Sun, he fortified the settlement with wooden stockades and built a thriving trade town, often referred to as Nimoar’s Hold. Yet, even his rule was tested when hordes of trolls descended from the north, forcing the fledgling city into a desperate fight for survival.


        Amid the chaos, a young mage named @[](gsepwfxkts) emerged. Using his developing powers, he turned the tide against the trolls, eventually earning the people’s trust and rising to prominence.


        ### Ahghairon and the Birth of the Open Lords


        By the year 1520yrs BTS(Before The Sundering), @[](gsepwfxkts) had become a figure of immense power and influence, prolonging his life through magic. When the ruling warlord, @[](hldquppkch), sought to use Sunset Spire’s wealth and armies to create a northern empire, Ahghairon stood against him. In a dramatic confrontation, the mage transformed Raurlor’s sword into a serpent that struck him dead.


        Seizing the opportunity, Ahghairon declared a new order. He established the system of governance that endures to this day, with an @[](dyhxfrvpvw) presiding alongside a council of secret lords whose identities remain hidden. Ahghairon himself became the first Open Lord, shaping the city’s guilds, laws, and famed institutions such as the @[](tjgyldglaq).


        Ahghairon ruled wisely for two centuries before his magic failed. He is entombed in his tower, now encased in wards so powerful that the skeleton of a would-be thief floats suspended in air a grim warning to the curious.


        ### Cataclysms of Sunset Spire


        Sunset Spire has endured many trials, but none greater than the three great cataclysms that have shaped the world:


        #### The Time the Gods Walked on Trotroles


        In the year 1358 years BTS, the gods of @[](klgsnmpeuf) were cast down from their divine realms by the Overgod @[](ceaaoncmkj). For the first time, beings such as @[](djhxbqikic), @[](eywqiqxwbn), and @[](jelbdpmbrr) among mortals. This upheaval began with the theft of the Tablets of Fate, ancient artifacts said to define the domains and powers of the gods.


        Ao demanded their return, but chaos reigned in the meantime. Wars, divine miracles, and devastating magical battles scarred the land. Sunset Spire stood at the heart of these events, its survival credited to the efforts of great heroes, including the enigmatic mage Khelmar Dusksoul and the legendary Open lord @[](xbhhhfnkvt).


        Eventually, the Tablets were restored, and the gods returned to their planes. However, the scars of this era linger in myth and memory.


        #### The Shaking of the World


        Centuries later, @[](klgsnmpeuf) was rocked by a time of cataclysmic earthquakes and tsunamis, known simply as The Shaking of the World. Entire cities vanished into the sea, and towering statues of the gods and heroes of old awoke, walking across the land in acts of both salvation and destruction.


        In Sunset Spire, one such statue, the @[](ftunmvxtae), strode into the harbor, saving thousands from the encroaching waves before toppling into the sea itself. Its submerged remains are now a popular site for divers and scholars.


        The Shaking reshaped the coastline, expanded the Deepwater Harbor, and forever changed the lives of the city's inhabitants.


        #### The Sundering


        Only a year has passed since The Sundering, a thousand-year period of no magic, came to an end. Though its cause remains a mystery, this era plunged Trotroles into chaos. The absence of magic brought the collapse of kingdoms, the loss of enchanted wonders, and the decline of belief in the old gods.


        Today, the faith of the people has shifted. Few now worship beings like @[](ddnkcwmgay). Instead, they honor abstract ideals: the cycle of life and death, the persistence of the seasons, and the enduring strength of community. The old temples, like the Chapel of Nerull, have become places of quiet reflection where people gather not to pray but to remember their loved ones and ponder life’s mysteries.


        The return of magic has rekindled hope, but its origins remain unknown. Scholars and mages alike search for answers, while the people of Sunset Spire rebuild their lives in the wake of this profound upheaval.


        ----


        As Sunset Spire endures, so too do its people. The city remains a beacon of resilience, a place where history is written not just in the annals of the great, but in the lives of those who call it home.

        # $[objectname]


        Welcome to @[](izwulaovpv), a vibrant hub of culture and civilization on @[](klgsnmpeuf). While its majestic spires and bustling streets are marvels to behold, navigating the city can be as treacherous as it is rewarding for newcomers. With its own unique traditions, laws, and guardians, Sunset Spire is unlike any place you’ve ever visited. To help you thrive, here’s your essential guide to the city’s systems of law, order, and arcane regulation.


        ## The Code Legal


        Sunset Spire is no backwater village ruled by whim or chaos. Its governance and laws, guided by the wisdom of the @[](dyhxfrvpvw), reflect a commitment to fairness and order. Justice in Sunset Spire follows the Code Legal, a comprehensive framework outlining everything from the mildest infractions to the gravest offenses. Copies of the Code Legal can be requested from any magistrate or the Palace of the Sunset, and you’d do well to familiarize yourself with its tenets.


        * **Criminal Sentencing:** Punishments for crimes aren’t meted out in public spectacles. Instead, sentences are carried out discreetly, whether they involve fines, imprisonment, or—in the most severe cases—execution behind the Palace walls.

        * **Magisterial Oversight:** The city's magisters have considerable authority, and their judgments can only be overturned by the ruling Lords. However, such reversals are rare.


        * **Justice in Action:** You’ll seldom see chaos on the streets; disturbances are swiftly handled by the city’s professional enforcers. If you're innocent, you’ve little to fear—but beware, for justice here is as precise as it is inevitable.


        ## City Watch


        Known colloquially as the City Watch, the @[](xnsdcgycft) are the primary enforcers of law and order in Sunset Spire. These mercenaries, sworn to the Iron Vows, are a visible and formidable presence across the city. Unlike a traditional civic guard, the Bronze Hands operate under contract with the ruling Lords, offering their loyalty and blades to maintain the peace.


        * **Appearance:** Members of the Bronze Hands are easily identified by their polished bronze gauntlets, sturdy leather armor, and green-and-bronze tabards. Their standard armament includes long truncheons, bucklers, and short swords, though they seldom need more than their sheer discipline to deter trouble.

        *    **Civility in Force:** Despite their martial origins, the Bronze Hands are trained to de-escalate conflicts whenever possible. That said, any assault, theft, or public brawling will be met with swift and decisive action.

        *    **Structure:** While the Bronze Hands keep the peace on the streets, the elite @[](acksmetjoq) are reserved for crises and special missions. This structure ensures that justice is swift, whether on the street corner or in the darkest corners of the Spire.


        !!


        @[](xnsdcgycft)' Slang


        Familiarity with the Bronze Hands’ jargon can help you understand their directives—and avoid their ire:


        *    ***“What shadows stir?”*** = What’s happening here?

        *    ***“Down steel!”*** = Drop your weapons immediately.

        *    ***“Talk true!”*** = Speak honestly, or face consequences.

        *    ***“Fetch a lantern”*** = Call for a magister.


        You’ll find watch posts scattered throughout the Spire, each marked by a bronze-and-green lantern enchanted with continual flame. These serve as both bases for patrols and holding areas for those awaiting judgment. Avoid being among the latter.


        !!


        ## Arms, Armor, and Conflict


        While it’s not illegal to carry weapons or wear armor in Sunset Spire, it is decidedly unusual. The culture of civility and the omnipresence of the Bronze Hands make such displays unnecessary for most.


        *    **Weapon Taxes:** Blades over one foot in length are taxed heavily when purchased within the city, contributing to the rarity of visible swords and the prevalence of compact knives and clubs.

        *    **Dueling:** Any form of dueling or assault is prohibited. Public disputes are expected to be resolved through words or mediation by a magister.

        *    **Sport Combat:** Registered venues may host regulated sport fighting, but anything beyond that is swiftly shut down by the authorities. (The tavern brawls

        that typically break out under the influence of too much

        drink will often be overlooked by the Watch, as long as

        the proprietor doesn't seek payment for damages and

        no one is significantly injured.)


        ## The Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors


        Magic is a potent force in Sunset Spire, but its practice is carefully monitored. Arcane spellcasters intending to stay within the city must register with a magister upon arrival. Most are strongly encouraged to join the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, a guild overseen by the Iron Tower, which operates under the guidance of the Blackstaff (the leader of @[](acksmetjoq)).


        *    **Obligations:** Members of the Watchful Order assist with public safety, including investigations of magical crimes, disaster response, and maintaining arcane wards throughout the city.

        *    **Regulation:** Even those who choose not to join are closely watched. The Order is responsible for ensuring rogue spellcasters don’t endanger the city.

        *    **Community:** Membership comes with access to resources, camaraderie, and the opportunity to demonstrate responsibility to the city's rulers.


        ## Coinage


        As with any city of renown, Sunset Spire mints its own currency. Taxes, guild fees, and fines must be paid in the city’s coinage or that of allied settlements within the League of the Iron Accord. While merchants and establishments may accept foreign currency, expect some hesitation—especially from the likes of dray operators and swift-exchange vendors—who prefer the city’s standardized coins to avoid the hassle of assessing purity and value.


        For travelers carrying foreign coin, exchanges are straightforward. The Exchequer's Hall, situated near the Council Spire, offers fair rates with no additional fees, though appointments are often necessary due to high demand. Alternatively, licensed members of the Guild of Fine Scales provide swift and reliable exchanges at standardized rates.


        Before leaving, be sure to exchange any Crests or Forges (local terms for silver and gold denominations). Outside the city, they lose much of their recognized value.


        * **Copper Coin:** Sunset Nail

        The most common and modest coin, often used for daily purchases, small tolls, and common trades.


        * **Silver Coin:** Moonlit Shard

        Representing ten Copper Coins, these are the standard medium of exchange for most merchants and services.


        * **Bronze Coin:** Sunforge Crest

        Worth 1 Bronze Coin for every ten Silver Coins, this currency is associated with more significant transactions or specialized goods.


        * **Gold Coin:** Golden Phoenix

        A highly-valued denomination, representing wealth and nobility. Gold Coins are prized by merchants and adventurers.


        * **Platinum Coin:** Starbound Sovereign

        The highest denomination in Sunset Spire’s monetary system. Platinum is reserved for very large payments, diplomatic transactions, or rare treasures.


        ## Taxes and Fees


        The Council of Lords ensures Sunset Spire’s continued prosperity by levying fair but firm taxes on its residents and visitors:


        *   **Residential Tax:** Every household must contribute a Sunlit Crest per resident over the age of ten each month. This is collected door-to-door by patrols of the Bronze Hands, the city’s contracted watch force. If the patrol finds no one home, they leave a lien notice, and the tax must be paid to a Magister's Hall within the next month.

        *    **Annual Exemption:** For those wishing to avoid monthly visits, a Glinting Forge (the gold denomination) secures a writ of exemption for a full year. However, keep this writ close at hand; without it, expect a knock from the patrol.

        *    **Transient Tax:** Residents without fixed homes are not exempt. If encountered in a public or private building on collection day, expect to be taxed on the spot.


        Additional fees may apply for commerce and city services:


        *    **Market Stall Rentals:** 1 Crest per day.

        *    **Conviction Fees:** A flat 1 Sunlit Crest in addition to any magister-imposed fines.

        *    **Export Taxes:** 1 Forge per conveyance leaving the city.

        *    **Docking Fees:** 5 Forges per ship for a fourteen-day stay.


        In times of crisis, emergency taxes—like the Wall Levy or Lance Fund—may be imposed to address city needs. These are generally short-term and tied to specific purposes such as city defenses or infrastructure repair.


        ## Getting Around Sunset Spire

        The Sunset Spire is a labyrinth of gilded avenues and shadowed alleyways, bustling with activity from dawn to dusk. For newcomers, understanding the city’s flow is crucial for avoiding delays—or worse, offending the locals.

        ### Traffic and Travel


        The city’s main roads, such as Phoenix Avenue and the Golden Path, hum with life day and night. Expect a chaotic blend of wagons, drays, hire-coaches, mounted riders, and the occasional noble carriage. Fortunately, the Iron Vows ensure the thoroughfares remain navigable, with traffic wardens—members of the Bronze Hands—directing movement during peak hours. Look for their distinct signals:


        *    **Blue Flag: Proceed.**

        *    **Yellow Flag: Hold.**


        Failure to obey a warden’s directive may result in a fine or a brusque detainment by the Bronze Hands.


        ### Drays


        A marvel of ingenuity, Sunset Spire's drays are towering vehicles with glassed-in compartments and open-air seating on the roof. Drivers sit atop these rolling behemoths, commanding an elevated view of the crowded streets. For a modest fee (2–4 shards), passengers can ride in comfort, either inside or on the breezy upper deck. These drays primarily service major boulevards and the Azure Plaza near the central market.


        During busy times or inclement weather, be prepared for crowded conditions and vigilant for pickpockets.


        ### Hire-Coaches


        For personal travel, wave down one of the city’s numerous hire-coaches—black, two-wheeled vehicles designed for comfort and speed. These hold two to four passengers and can be hired for pre agreed fares, rarely exceeding half a dozen Sunlit Crests.


        ### Luxury Carriages

        For the affluent or celebratory, full carriages provide opulent travel with silk-lined interiors and professional attendants. These are perfect for city tours or special events, with prices varying by duration and service.


        ### Street Signs


        Navigating Sunset Spire is eased by the meticulous work of the Illuminators’(Scribes), Guild, whose members ensure that street names and alleys are clearly marked. Signs vary by district but are commonly carved in stone or displayed on wooden placards affixed to buildings. Look for these markers at intersections for guidance.


        ## Nobility in Sunset Spire


        While dignitaries from distant lands may visit Sunset Spire, the noble families you truly need to acquaint yourself with are those of the city itself. Sunset Spire boasts thirty-two noble houses, many of which trace their ancestry back to the founding days of the Spire when it was but a fledgling trade hub. Each house wields immense influence not just in the city but often across the Southern Isles and the bordering Dominion States.


        Entire volumes could be filled with tales of their alliances, rivalries, and accomplishments, but let this guide serve as your introduction to recognizing and navigating the intricacies of noble society.


        ### Recognizing a Noble


        In Sunset Spire, nobility is granted the right to bear arms of station. This allows each house to retain up to fifty armed retainers, all bearing the heraldic crest of their house. These retainers serve as both soldiers and symbols of status, donning the noble colors and insignias prominently on cloaks, shields, and armor.


        Foreign dignitaries or local guildmasters may keep no more than ten armed guards, and even they are required to wear plain attire to avoid confusion with noble retinues. This stark difference in display means that a group of soldiers adorned with heraldry is the clearest indication you are in the presence of nobility.


        Nobles, especially younger scions, often travel light or even unaccompanied when seeking entertainment or intrigue. In these cases, deference from others will be your best clue to their station. Follow their lead, bowing your head or offering a small nod of acknowledgment. Always address a known noble as "Lord" or "Lady", and never presume familiarity unless expressly invited. While no laws govern the manner of address, insulting a noble family—even unintentionally—can have far-reaching consequences. In Sunset Spire, grudges are carried not just by individuals but by entire houses, often for generations.


        If uncertain of someone’s status, “Saer” (for gentlemen) or “Goodwoman” (for gentlewomen) are safe and respectful forms of address. Nobles will typically correct you with grace if higher titles are warranted.


        ### Nobles and Patronage


        he noble families of @[](izwulaovpv) are deeply embedded in the city’s cultural and economic life. They serve as patrons for everything from burgeoning businesses to the arts, lavish festivals, and even military expeditions. They also underwrite city-wide celebrations, tournaments in the @[](gemqysknwk), and the maintenance of temples and shrines dedicated to the city’s many deities. Whether motivated by altruism, political ambition, or family pride, these actions earn nobles loyalty and reverence among the populace.


        If you seek the patronage of a noble, tread carefully. Etiquette demands an introduction, typically through a trusted intermediary in the noble’s employ. Approaching a noble unbidden risks offending them and tarnishing your reputation. To succeed, make your accomplishments known, and let the nobles come to you. Those who distinguish themselves in their chosen fields often find themselves invited into noble circles.


        ### Navigating Noble Networks


        When dealing with a noble in Sunset Spire, you are rarely interacting with an individual. Each noble is part of an intricate web of familial ties, alliances, and rivalries. Unwittingly slighting a noble family’s ally—or assisting their rival—can embroil you in feuds that stretch far beyond the city’s gilded avenues. Research the family and their known associates before engaging in any dealings, or consult with a reputable solicitor for guidance.


        ## Guilds and Guild Law in Sunset Spire


        Every profession in @[](izwulaovpv) falls under the purview of one of the city’sofficial guilds. From merchants to masons, bakers to brewers, and sailors to scribes, guilds regulate the commerce and craftsmanship that drive the city’s economy. Their influence is so pervasive that the term Guild Law is as much a part of local parlance as civic law.


        Though not explicitly codified, Guild Law is strictly enforced. Guild members are fiercely protective of their domains and traditions, with punishments for transgressions often being as creative as they are severe. For example:


        * A brewer selling ale below the guild-standard price might find their kegs emptied in public.

        * A member of the Guild of Taleweavers who fails to uphold a bardic contract may be barred from performing in any inn or tavern for a season.

        * A merchant unloading goods at the docks without involving the Harbormaster’s Guild risks having their wares confiscated or thrown into the harbor.


        ### Navigating Guild Protocols


        To do business in Sunset Spire, you must adhere to guild protocols. For instance, constructing a building involves consulting multiple guilds:


        1. Surveyors’ Guild: Approves the plot and provides the initial plans.

        2. Excavators’ Union: Clears and prepares the land.

        3. Builders’ Guild: Constructs the primary structure.

        4. Glaziers’ Circle and Fine Carvers’ Guild: Handle decorative work and custom fixtures.

        5. Wrights’ Guild: Installs windows, waterworks, or metalwork.


        Attempting to bypass a guild’s involvement may not be illegal but will make you an enemy of their powerful networks. Businesses found circumventing guild membership or rules often face boycotts, leaving them unable to buy supplies, hire workers, or find shelter in the city. Joining a guild is not just practical—it is essential.


        For visitors or newcomers to the city, navigating these complexities can be daunting. Seeking the advice of a local solicitor or guild member is highly recommended. A small upfront cost will save you a wealth of trouble.

        Newcomers to @[](izwulaovpv) are often baffled by the weight its citizens place on the city’s wards. Unlike cities such as @[](eelbfhylec) or @[](zysdomlhjn) where districts are defined by natural barriers like rivers or towering walls, Sunset Spire’s wards are often separated by something as simple as a street or even a well-trodden alley. This has led to no small amount of amusement among the drivers of the city’s tram-shell coaches, who delight in ferrying confused travelers across a street only to claim it was an arduous journey to a "distant ward."


        Each ward in @[](izwulaovpv) boasts its own distinct history, traditions, and eccentricities. Some are shaped by past residents, while others are defined by strange events that linger in legend. Consider, for instance, Asmagh’s Alley in the Castle Ward., where citizens shuffle sideways while passing the ancient cobbled thoroughfare. This peculiar custom stems from an old tale of a lantern-maker who used his craft to secretly spy on neighbors, only to be cursed by the very moonsilver he worked. His lingering spirit is said to trail those who dare walk with their backs to his former workshop. Children passing the lane even sing a rhyme:

        "Sideways we shuffle, lanterns beware, forward is folly, his eyes are still there."


        ### The Spirit of the Wards

        The wards are more than just geographic divisions. They are sources of pride and identity for the people of Sunset Spire. The city’s many festivals and competitions often feature fierce rivalries between wards, with residents proudly donning their ward’s colors, raising mascots, and singing songs that echo through the city’s towering spires. Stay in Sunset Spire for even a few weeks, and you’ll find yourself swept up in this lively civic spirit.

        Perched on the western cliffs, the Oceanview Ward is @[](izwulaovpv)’s most opulent district, home to its noble estates, grand manors, and exclusive boutiques. Here, where the setting sun kisses the sea, the wealth of the Spire shines brightest.


        Generations ago, when the city’s merchant princes and Lords grew rich from trade across the seas, they built magnificent villas overlooking the waves. Many of these homes still stand, their gilded gates and marble facades telling tales of wealth accumulated through bold ventures and cunning alliances. Visitors can catch a splendid view of the Oceanview Ward’s sprawling grandeur by standing at the intersection of Diamond Street and Delzorin Street.


        ### Key Attractions of Oceanview ward


        **@[](thiuvnamcq)**


        A central draw to the ward is the Radiant Coliseum, a breathtaking amphitheater carved into the cliffs overlooking the Glittering Gulf. By day, it hosts trials of strength and daring; by night, it comes alive with shimmering lights and performances that defy the laws of nature and magic alike. The elite flock here, not just for entertainment, but to see and be seen, as deals are struck and alliances forged in the gilded viewing boxes.


        **@[](dxanpzbcjd)**


        A short walk from the Coliseum stands the Celestial Workshop, a temple and innovation hub dedicated to the abstract divine essence of creation. It brims with inventors and dreamers attempting feats of unparalleled ingenuity. From clockwork constructs to celestial globes that map the heavens, the Workshop offers marvels for both the devout and the curious.


        **@[](gxmvyyrmis)**


        Amidst the elegance of the Starlight Ward lie the Skyshadow Shrines, small but deeply spiritual gardens dedicated to the ideas of reverence and wonder. Though many modern visitors see them as serene places for reflection, the shrines retain artifacts and iconography from a thousand years ago, when specific deities were more actively venerated. The soft glow of enchanted lanterns ensures the pathways remain a tranquil haven after sunset.


        **@[](bqjvdmvfgh)**


        Legends abound of Sapphire Alley, a place whispered about but seldom spoken of openly. If you stumble upon its telltale azure tiles glowing faintly under starlight, you are advised to turn back. The alley is said to shift, its exits vanishing once crossed, and few who enter ever return. Still, tales of glittering treasures hidden within tempt the occasional explorer.


        **@[](pzhrxvcpwp)**


        Tucked into the quieter northern reaches of the ward lies the Heroes' Garden. This verdant park pays homage to Sunset Spire’s history through exquisite statues and fountains. Unlike the private courtyards of nobles, this green space is open to all—a rare respite for those who crave beauty without barriers.


        ## @[](tgyegrtqab)

        ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG4.ZB3.AlJkjUor_wKBmaEV?pid=ImgGn)


        @[](tgyegrtqab) of @[](izwulaovpv) offers a quiet, dignified counterpoint to the opulence and spectacle of its southern neighbor. While @[](gtaralcdqo) dazzles with its grandeur, the Northspire Ward is a haven of refinement and calm, where the city’s prosperous but less ostentatious elite have made their home.


        Lining the ward’s winding streets are stately row houses and modestly grand estates, each marked by its well-tended gardens and discreet elegance. Here, the families of merchants, financiers, scholars, and civic leaders live with an air of understated affluence. Though their means afford them a comfortable lifestyle—complete with a small retinue of household staff—many prefer to project humility, often remarking on the importance of hard work and steady hands.


        The ward is known for its pristine cleanliness, its polite manners, and a charming lack of pretense, which contrasts with the more flamboyant quarters of the city. Flowering vines cascade over wrought-iron fences, and the scent of fresh-baked goods drifts out from quaint bakeries that have served generations of locals. Even the inns and taverns here reflect the ward’s genteel character, favoring cozy parlors and subdued live music over raucous revelry.


        ### Attractions of Note


        **@[](mvrngavavy)**



        At the heart of the Northspire Ward lies the Skylark Promenade, a cobblestone boulevard dotted with boutiques, antique shops, and tea houses. The promenade is a favored meeting place for quiet conversations and leisurely walks, its charming lampposts casting a soft glow as evening falls.


        **@[](ugtbvkjyxj)**


        This small but renowned library holds a wealth of knowledge and history, with many volumes focused on the city’s own storied past. Established centuries ago, it serves as both a public resource and a private study for those seeking insight into Sunset Spire’s roots. The archivists are known for their discretion and depth of knowledge, making this a favored haunt of scholars and those pursuing a quiet intellectual retreat.


        **@[](widkgqjewc)**


        Tucked into quiet courtyards and along serene lanes are small sanctuaries known collectively as the Shrines of Hearth and Harmony. These spaces, originally dedicated to deities of home and community, still bear traces of ancient worship—symbols and relics that speak to a bygone age. Today, they are more often used for reflection, meditation, and communal gatherings, a testament to the enduring spirit of shared peace in the ward.


        ## @[](avjrwegyuw)

        ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG2.ihQ8lrtAvsRAyLyq5FFc?pid=ImgGn)


        The @[](avjrwegyuw), sometimes called the heart and mind of Sunset Spire, is a bastion of governance, history, and strength located in the city's southwest quarter. This ward encompasses the towering @[](vfkmmbarfa), a plateau that dominates the city’s skyline, and stretches down to the Docks of Azure Bay on the southern shore of the island. The Bastion Ward is a place where history and power intertwine, the foundations of the city itself echoing through its streets and institutions.


        At its peak stands @[](gdmuzbspay), an imposing fortress that rises from the @[](vfkmmbarfa), its battlements offering commanding views over both the city and the bay. This mighty keep is a redoubt of last defense, a symbol of the city's enduring resilience. Its purpose is more martial than administrative; it serves as a shield for @[](izwulaovpv)e in times of peril rather than a seat of governance.


        The governance of @[](izwulaovpv) flows from the @[](dvaiaempuo), a masterpiece of architecture nestled just below the heights. Known also as the Palace of Sun and Stars, the structure radiates elegance, its spires and arches crafted from gleaming marble. This palace houses the offices and chambers of the @[](wxcjupnjfe)—the enigmatic council of Sunset Spire—and the Sovereign @[](dyhxfrvpvw), who together shape the city’s future. Visitors to the palace often find themselves awestruck by the Audience Chamber, where the city’s ancient and humble throne—a blend of obsidian and mithril—stands as a symbol of unity and wisdom.


        Closer to the southern edges of the ward, the @[](wyizigbfux) hum with activity. As the lifeblood of Sunset Spire’s trade and naval power, this bustling harbor is both a gateway to distant lands and a safeguard for the city. The docks are flanked by shipyards, market stalls, and warehouses, their sounds mingling with the calls of seagulls and the rhythmic crash of waves.


        From the heights of Celestine to the vibrant life of the southern docks, the Bastion Ward is a living tapestry of Sunset Spire’s strength, history, and vision. Whether navigating its bustling streets or gazing at its awe-inspiring monuments, visitors quickly realize why this ward is considered the beating heart of the city.


        ### key locations


        **@[](gwvsbycdrv)**


        The Sixth Colossal Statue of Sunset Spire stands apart from its brethren as a symbol of balance and resilience, embodying the ideals of both enduring harmony and vigilance. Known as The Sentinel of the Setting Sun, this towering figure stretches toward the heavens, its arms forming an arc as though cradling the horizon. The Sentinel’s form is both awe-inspiring and humbling, sculpted to appear robed in swirling light and shadow, representing the duality of day’s end and the promise of a new dawn. Its helm-like face bears no discernible features, lending an air of mystery and universality to its visage.


        The Sentinel’s distinctive characteristic is its Eternal Gaze, a magical phenomenon that allows its eyes to glow softly with a golden light at sunset. This illumination reflects the city’s vibrant life and the setting sun's warmth. At midnight, the glow shifts to a silvery luminescence, echoing the moonlight over the sea. The people of Sunset Spire say it watches over the city as both guardian and guide, a reminder of their enduring connection to celestial cycles.


        **@[](updvlqhqag)**


        The Hall of Enduring Light stands as a tribute to a long-lost god of light, whose name has faded into obscurity since the Great Sundering fractured divine worship. Once dedicated to a deity of illumination, truth, and warmth, the hall has retained its radiant beauty and sacred aura, even as faith has evolved into more abstract practices.


        Massive stained-glass windows dominate the structure, each depicting an abstract interplay of golden and white light cascading through angular, celestial shapes. When sunlight streams through these windows, the hall is bathed in a mesmerizing glow, transforming the space into a sanctuary of peace and clarity.


        Visitors often remark on the hall’s Beacon Chamber, a high-vaulted space crowned by a crystal dome. At certain times of the year, when the sun aligns with the spire of the Hall, a beam of pure light shines directly through the dome, filling the chamber with a brilliance that symbolizes renewal and hope. The enduring light of this beam is believed to carry fragments of the original deity's power, offering solace and guidance to those who seek it.


        The Hall of Enduring Light is a cherished monument of Sunset Spire, a place where the remnants of an ancient god’s essence continue to inspire the hearts and minds of all who step inside. It is a hallmark of the city's layered history, blending the sacred and the secular into something uniquely enduring.

        ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG2.nsMc6afax.wvx59B5pri?pid=ImgGn)


        Shopping, dining, revelry, and artistry abound! The Trades Ward of @[](izwulaovpv) is a dazzling tapestry of bustling streets, eclectic goods, and vibrant life. If the Market Square in Celestine is the city’s beating heart, the Trades Ward is its constant pulse — a sprawling, multi-layered district that never truly sleeps. Streets hum with the calls of vendors, while balconies crisscross the skyline, stacked as high as five stories above, creating an intricate web of commerce and community. It’s a place where every step promises discovery, from colorful shopfronts boasting elaborate signs to walls plastered with bold advertisements vying for attention.


        Here, you can find everything imaginable: delicate gloves, custom shoes, glittering jewelry, intoxicating perfumes, exquisite flowers, decadent cakes, rare spices, armor of the finest craftsmanship, spell components, and more. Fine inns, cozy cafés, dance studios, and taverns tucked into every corner promise refreshment and entertainment. If it’s not explicitly outlawed, the Trades Ward has it — and if it is, whispers in shadowed corners might still point the way. The City Watch maintains a heavy presence, patrolling openly and covertly to keep the peace amid the chaos.


        The ward is also the hub of many guilds, their halls ranging from modest to grandiose. Among them is @[](xkxkxesbnt), home to the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters. Outside this iconic hall stands an ever-growing mountain of wax, where hundreds of candles burn day and night, their scents mingling in the air. Inside, visitors are treated to an astonishing array of creations: ornate lamps, chandeliers that sparkle like the stars, and fantastical wax sculptures depicting everything from mythical beasts to intricate geometric wonders.


        **@[](xrvthiquqq)**


        In the heart of the Trades Ward lies the Court of the White Bull, a plaza steeped in both history and mystery. Once a tranquil grazing ground for livestock, the area gained its name from an albino calf born here centuries ago. Its owner built a now-legendary tavern, the White Bull, which flourished for years until it was obliterated during a catastrophic magical duel between the archmage Thongalar the Mighty and the infamous mage Shile Rauretilar.


        The clash left scars deeper than the loss of the tavern. The Weave itself was torn asunder, forcing the intervention of Azuth, the god of wizards, who mended the rift but left behind a lingering flaw. Even now, the use of magic within the court is perilous, prone to wild and unpredictable effects. To prevent disaster, magic use and enchanted items are forbidden in this space. Despite its dangers, the Court of the White Bull is a popular gathering spot, its eerie reputation drawing the curious and the daring.


        The Trades Ward has embraced its lively, unpredictable spirit in its choice of mascot and traditions. The ward’s official colors, green and purple, evoke its vibrancy, but its mascot — the mimic — captures its essence. This tradition began humorously when early residents selected a chest of gold as their emblem, only for others to mock it as unimaginative. In response, the ward doubled down, declaring a new mimic mascot every four years.


        The reveal of each new mimic — often a common object transformed into an icon of whimsy — is a much-anticipated event. This object becomes the subject of playful pranks across the city, with gnomes crafting enchanted illusions, artisans creating edible replicas, and jesters spinning clever tales. The current mimic, a tankard, has led to endless shenanigans in taverns across Sunset Spire.


        Whether you come for trade, revelry, or simple curiosity, the Trades Ward offers something for everyone. Its lively streets and towering balconies are a testament to the city’s spirit of creativity, ambition, and unrelenting energy. Just don’t forget to keep a hand on your purse and an eye out for mimics — real or otherwise!



        ## @[](lsgkbihper)

        ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG3.SdK2mg_8LhBOc9kOvWB3?w=1024&h=1024&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)


        Known proudly as the Southern Ward—never simply "the South Ward"—this district of @[](izwulaovpv) holds a special place in the city’s heart. The name pays homage to the southern traders, artisans, and travelers who made it their home generations ago. Rich in culture and steeped in tradition, the Southern Ward is a vibrant tapestry of flavors, sounds, and sights. Though it serves as the city’s gateway for overland commerce, its true charm lies in the people and stories that define it.


        The ward’s streets are lively with activity, and its architecture is as diverse as its inhabitants. Homes and businesses are often built atop stables or clustered around expansive inn yards, catering to caravans and travelers. It’s not uncommon to hear the joyful chatter of merchants unloading exotic goods or the laughter of children playing in courtyards. Halfling bakeries send mouthwatering aromas into the air, Calishite musicians weave mesmerizing melodies through the bustling streets, and dwarven smiths proudly display masterful creations in small but meticulously curated shops.


        Navigating the ward is an adventure in itself. Hidden gems await around every corner, from unassuming taverns serving the finest mead to courtyards hosting impromptu performances. Travelers and locals alike delight in the endless surprises this ward offers, though finding them often requires a keen eye and a bit of persistence.


        **The Spirit of the @[](lsgkbihper)**


        Residents of the Southern Ward are deeply proud of their reputation as hardworking and hospitable folk. Their symbol, a mule in rampant pose, captures this spirit perfectly. On banners of red and white—their official colors—the mule represents the grit and determination of those who labor in service of Sunset Spire’s travelers and citizens. “Blood and tears,” they say, built this ward, and those who live here honor that legacy daily.


        Though much of the Southern Ward’s fame comes from its industrious nature, it’s also home to one of the most enchanting spectacles in all of Sunset Spire: the @[](zfcsrvfynr)


        **The @[](zfcsrvfynr) and the Dancing Court**


        When the full moon graces the night sky, the Moon Sphere manifests in the Dancing Court, bathing the square in a glowing, ethereal light. This supernatural orb of blue radiance allows any creature within it to defy gravity, soaring through the air with nothing but a thought. Over centuries, the people of @[](izwulaovpv) have developed a style of aerial dance within the sphere—a mesmerizing blend of acrobatics and artistry.


        The @[](zfcsrvfynr) is not a constant presence; it appears only during the full moon and, on rare occasions, in daylight. While most performances are the domain of seasoned dancers, visitors can join in during daylight appearances, making it a must-visit for those eager to experience the ward’s magic firsthand.


        Even without the @[](zfcsrvfynr), the Dancing Court is a lively destination thanks to the adjoining festhall, @[](hxordujmma). This three-story establishment offers a mix of revelry, elegance, and mystery. Its balconies provide daring guests the chance to leap into the Moon Sphere, while its tavern and dance halls offer music and merriment to those on firmer ground.


        The festhall takes its name from its most famous resident: an eight-foot-tall jade statue of a woman. The Jade Dancer, as she’s known, is no ordinary decoration. With graceful movements that rival the finest dancers in the city, she entertains patrons with her hypnotic performances. But her beauty conceals her strength—those who test the limits of festhall decorum often find themselves on the receiving end of her unyielding stone hands. Legends say the Jade Dancer is as powerful as any golem, a guardian of the ward’s joy and harmony.



        ## @[](jyuflfgbbw)

        ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG4.QOzYBlkJ.nX5DIxjzC76?pid=ImgGn)


        For generations, the @[](jyuflfgbbw) of @[](izwulaovpv) has been whispered about as the city’s roughest quarter, but those who know it well might argue otherwise. Though life here is undeniably hard, and its streets lack the polish of the more prosperous wards, the Dock Ward brims with resilience and character. It remains the beating heart of Sunset Spire’s maritime trade, where towering masts frame the skyline and the air carries the mingling scents of salt, fish, and the ever-present sea breeze.


        It’s true that the Dock Ward hosts many of the city’s poorest residents, and yes, it has its fair share of shadowy corners and unsavory taverns. Yet, this is also where you’ll find some of Sunset Spire’s most hardworking souls—stevedores, fishmongers, shipwrights, and sailors who endure grueling conditions to keep the city fed, supplied, and thriving. Beneath the ward’s gritty surface lies a tightly knit community that watches out for its own, with a fierce pride in their shared struggles and victories.


        **Life Along the Docks**


        The landscape of the Dock Ward is a chaotic maze of warehouses, weathered tenements, and bustling piers. Its steep streets wind unpredictably, narrowing in places to tight alleys where even the sun struggles to reach. Shop signs are rare; many businesses operate on word-of-mouth reputation alone. If you’re new to the area, you’d best bring a guide—or risk finding yourself hopelessly lost among the indistinguishable buildings.


        Streetlamps, though technically present, rarely remain functional for long. Their candles and glass panes are frequently stolen, leaving the streets shrouded in darkness after sunset. Residents accustomed to this bring their own lanterns when venturing out at night, their bobbing lights creating an almost eerie glow as they traverse the uneven cobblestones.


        While the ward lacks the splendor of other districts, the piers are alive with activity from dawn until well into the night. Merchants haggle loudly, sailors unload exotic wares, and the rhythmic creak of ships at anchor forms a constant backdrop. Though many inns here cater to transient sailors and charge by the hour, a few honest establishments offer a warm meal and a good story to those willing to overlook a leaky roof or an uneven floor.


        ## The @[](wkcfmpcwly)

        The Greenward, Sunset Spire’s renowned necropolis, is far more than a final resting place for the city’s departed. This sprawling, verdant sanctuary is a marvel of beauty and history, offering a place for reflection, remembrance, and quiet admiration. Far from being a dreary cemetery, it is a grand park where life and legacy coexist in harmony. Rolling grassy hills, meticulously tended flowerbeds, elegant clusters of trees, and masterfully placed sculptures create a serene landscape unlike any other.


        Sunset Spire’s citizens moved away from traditional burial practices long ago. Today, the deceased are laid to rest in elaborate mausoleums that connect to extradimensional spaces. This innovation not only preserves the city’s precious land but allows families to honor their loved ones with an artistry that rivals even the city’s most opulent galleries.


        The mausoleums, ranging from intimate familial crypts to grand monuments, are the heart of the Greenward. Here, wealthy merchants and nobles vie to commission the most magnificent memorials, resulting in a breathtaking array of sculptural styles. Marble figures weep in quiet mourning, bronze warriors stand eternal vigil, and abstract designs capture the ephemeral nature of life and death. Walking through the Greenward feels like stepping into a vast, open-air museum curated by time itself.


        **@[](ysafsntrbk)** 


        Among the Greenward’s many wonders, one stands above the rest: the Valor’s Apex, a monumental fountain sculpture that soars into the sky. It depicts a tableau of Sunset Spire’s defenders in heroic battle—men and women driving back marauding trolls, hobgoblins, orcs, and worse. At its pinnacle, a griffon rider strikes a fearsome skeletal knight bearing the sigil of @[](zcsbadqatc), the god of decay and despair.


        But this isn’t merely a static piece of art; it is a dynamic fountain, where the wounds of both hero and foe spill crystal-clear water that cascades down the sculpture in mesmerizing streams. A symbol of sacrifice and triumph, the Valor’s Apex captures the spirit of Sunset Spire’s resilience.


        The Greenward is more than its monuments. It is a haven where citizens come to find solace. Families picnic on its lush lawns, poets seek inspiration beneath its ancient oaks, and lovers stroll its winding gravel paths, hand in hand.


        ---


        In Sunset Spire, death is not the end but a part of the city’s story. The Greenward ensures that story is told beautifully, for all who wish to listen.

        The Field Ward of Sunset Spire was not always the bustling, chaotic sprawl it is today. Once an open expanse between the city’s northernmost walls, it was originally left bare as a defensive killing field in times of war. Over time, however, it became a haven for those with nowhere else to turn—refugees from calamities, outcasts, and the dispossessed. In their determination to build a life within sight of Sunset Spire’s gates, they transformed the area into a sprawling, self-made district.


        Though not officially recognized as one of the city's wards, the Field Ward operates as a de facto district, teeming with makeshift homes, muddy streets, and a rough-hewn community spirit. It is a place where desperation and resilience collide. Lacking oversight from the City Watch and barely under the purview of the City Guard, lawlessness often reigns unchecked, and many crimes go unpunished. The Guard keeps a watchful eye from the walls but rarely intervenes unless the safety of those moving in and out of Sunset Spire is directly threatened.


        Life in the Field Ward is harsh. It lacks the basic amenities afforded to other districts—there is no sewer system, and the Dungsweepers’ Guild doesn’t venture here. The air carries the pungent scent of uncollected waste and the acrid stench of the slaughterhouses, smokehouses, and leatherworks operated by the Guild of Butchers, which were forced out of the city proper due to their noisome practices. For all its grime and grittiness, the Field Ward is a hub of industrious activity and the site of many workers' first steps toward a better future.


        Travelers who find themselves here should tread carefully. Befriending a butcher or a craftsman—those accustomed to wielding sharp knives—is a wise move. T@[](koxetcapaf), located at the corner of Endshift Street and Breezeway, offers a glimmer of safety. A favored haunt of off-duty City Guard members, it is one of the few places where outsiders can seek guidance or protection. While the guards are not obligated to intervene in Field Ward affairs, they are often willing to ensure travelers reach the city proper without harm—especially if reminded of their duty to safeguard visitors.


        The Field Ward, for all its challenges, is a testament to human resilience and determination. It may not possess the elegance or splendor of Sunset Spire’s grander districts, but it hums with the raw energy of survival and hope, offering a glimpse into the lives of those who labor in the shadow of the city’s walls.

        Describing all the marvels of Sunset Spire would require tomes beyond count, yet this humble text endeavors to highlight its unique splendors. While some features have been previously chronicled, this chapter unveils the comforts, ingenuity, and protections that make this city unmatched in the known world.


        ## Civilized Living

        Few cities in the realms rival Sunset Spire’s sophistication, where even the smallest details of daily life have been refined for ease and comfort. Where other towns endure the daily toil of hauling waste through the streets, the Spire boasts an intricate Aqueduct and Sanitation Network, connecting most buildings directly to subterranean channels. Public facilities are conveniently scattered throughout the vibrant Market and every major square.


        For areas not connected to this network, the Sweepers’ Guild performs tireless rounds. They collect refuse and waste separately—an innovation that benefits both industry and agriculture. Their diligent labor ensures the streets remain immaculate, with services funded through city taxes. Excessive refuse, however, does incur additional fees.


        The city's water system is equally remarkable. Fountains and wells abound, offering clean water to all. Many homes and businesses boast personal pumps, and wealthier buildings even feature taps that dispense water at the turn of a lever. These advancements are attributed to the ingenuity of the Mechanists’ Guild, the dedication of the Wellspring Consortium, and the legacy of ancient magic passed down from the Spire’s founding era.


        The city is also brilliantly illuminated. Continual flame spells brighten key districts, while the Luminars’ Guild oversees the maintenance of streetlamps. At dusk, enchanted Glow-Orbs emerge from the Garden in the @[](gtaralcdqo), dispersing throughout the city to provide soft light until dawn. This nightly phenomenon is unique to Sunset Spire, its origins shrouded in mystery and reverence.


        Finally, literacy flourishes across Sunset Spire. The Scribes’ Sanctuary, dedicated to knowledge and learning, offers free reading lessons to all. Broadsheets, advertisements, and menus are ubiquitous, ensuring even casual visitors can navigate the city’s thriving culture. While written works are less prevalent in the Shadow Market and Edgeward, they dominate the rest of the Spire, underscoring its reputation as a city of enlightenment.


        ## @[](tjgyldglaq)

        Sunset Spire’s skies are safeguarded not by enchanted ships or mechanical marvels but by the valiant Griffon Riders of Celestara. These aerial defenders, mounted upon noble and fearsome griffons, operate from their lofty stronghold, Bastion Keep, perched high on the rugged slopes of Mount Celectra. The riders are celebrated as masters of aerial combat, their skill augmented by the enchanted Rings of Celestial Grace, which enable breathtaking feats of precision and bravery.


        During both martial exhibitions and life-or-death engagements, the Griffon Riders distinguish themselves with daring tactics. Leaping boldly from their mounts, they hurtle toward their foes with dizzying speed, becoming streaks of determination against the sky. Few adversaries can withstand such a relentless assault, their attention split between the approaching rider and the circling griffon poised to strike. At the last moment, the Rings of Celestial Grace activate, halting the riders’ descent as they drift gently through the air. Their griffon companions, bound by trust and training, swoop in to reunite with their riders, transforming what seemed reckless into an awe-inspiring maneuver.


        The synchronization between rider and griffon is unparalleled, ensuring that no airborne or ground-based threat to Sunset Spire endures for long. A strict code keeps the Griffon Riders soaring above the rooftops—not for fear of collision, but to maintain the discipline of their steeds, whose keen senses can be overwhelmed by the tantalizing aromas of the bustling city below.


        The Griffon Riders of Celestara are more than just protectors; they are a symbol of Sunset Spire’s resilience and vigilance, embodying the city's unyielding spirit as they soar above, guardians of the heavens and the earth alike.

        The Guardians of Sunset Spire are legendary titans of stone and magic, their immense forms scattered across the city and its environs. Each tells a tale of heroism, resilience, and the enduring spirit of the Spire’s people. Unlike simple monuments, these Guardians are ancient protectors imbued with purpose and mystery, standing as both relics of a bygone age and symbols of hope for the future.

        Long before it became a submerged marvel, the Colossus of Celestara was a towering figure that strode from its resting place during the Shaking, an event that reshaped Sunset Spire’s coastline. As a massive tidal wave threatened the city, the Colossus marched into the harbor with unyielding purpose, its vast arms creating a barrier that deflected the devastating force of the sea. Thousands of lives were saved by its sacrifice as it stood fast against the encroaching waves before finally succumbing, collapsing into the depths.


        Today, the remnants of the Colossus of Celestara lie beneath the shimmering waters of Deepwater Harbor, a favored destination for divers, scholars, and treasure hunters alike. Its immense, seaweed-draped form has become a habitat for marine life, its presence a blend of myth and reality. Locals tell tales of faint magical glimmers seen in the deep at night, hinting that some lingering essence of the Colossus continues to watch over the harbor and its people.

        Shrouded in legend and completely hidden from sight, the Veiled Sanctum is the most enigmatic of Sunset Spire's guardians. Unlike its colossal brethren, its exact location remains unknown, concealed beneath layers of rock, city, and time. Scholars believe it resides deep beneath the @[](wkcfmpcwly), buried in a forgotten cavern network that predates even the city itself. Its form is described in ancient texts as a kneeling figure with a single outstretched hand, its other hand resting over its heart, embodying a protective presence over the Spire's hidden truths and unspoken history.


        Legends say the Veiled Sanctum possesses an aura of secrecy, known as the Shroud of Silence, a magical phenomenon that shields it from detection. Some whisper that its discovery will only come when the city is in dire need, as it is said to awaken and rise, drawing upon the memories of Sunset Spire's forgotten eras to guide its people toward survival.

        Embedded within the heart of Commerce Circle, the bustling marketplace of the @[](avjrwegyuw), lies the Market Sentinel, an ancient guardian whose lower half has been completely absorbed into the structures around it. Its towering upper body rises from the heart of the district, its stone arms spread wide as if cradling the bustling life of the market beneath its protective gaze. Weathered by centuries of trade and commerce, its surface is covered in carvings of coins, celestial patterns, and the names of long-forgotten traders who left offerings at its base.


        Despite its stationary appearance, the Market Sentinel plays an active role in city life. Its Echoing Pulse sends vibrations through the stones of the district, an ability believed to deter theft and deceit. Merchants claim that items stolen within its reach often find their way back to their rightful owners, guided by the Sentinel’s mysterious influence. Locals consider it both a protector of trade and a witness to the ever-turning wheel of fortune in the Spire.

        Rising within the @[](gtaralcdqo), where grand estates and gleaming manors stand in the shadow of its colossal form, the Gilded Bastion is both a relic of the past and a part of everyday life for the district’s affluent citizens. Over time, homes have been built into and around the Bastion’s immense, stoic figure, with its upper body visible above the rooftops. The guardian’s left arm forms a bridge between two towering mansions, while its right hand is raised as if warding off an unseen threat.


        The Gilded Bastion is revered as the protector of prosperity and legacy. Its Golden Glow, a faint light emanating from the runes etched across its stone surface, brightens whenever the district faces a crisis. Locals believe it safeguards the ward not only from physical harm but also from decay and ruin. Its presence serves as a reminder of resilience and the enduring legacy of Sunset Spire's founding families.

        Standing sentinel at the mouth of Deepwater Harbor, the Keeper of Tides is a massive figure rising partially submerged from the waves, its weathered stone surface encrusted with barnacles and coral. With one hand resting protectively upon the harbor’s waters and the other clutching a staff crowned with a luminous orb, it embodies the city’s bond with the sea and its reliance upon maritime life.


        The Keeper’s Orb, a source of perpetual light, serves both as a navigational beacon for sailors and a symbol of the city's prosperity. During storms, the orb glows brighter, casting its radiant glow across the harbor to guide ships to safety. Locals whisper that during the worst tempests, the Keeper seems to stir, its massive hand rising slightly to shield the harbor from the brunt of the waves, its quiet vigilance a comfort to all who depend on the sea.
